mate-text-editor is a small, but powerful text editor designed specifically for
the MATE desktop. It has most standard text editor functions and fully
supports international text in Unicode. Advanced features include syntax
highlighting and automatic indentation of source code, printing and editing
of multiple documents in one window.

mate-text-editor is extensible through a plugin system, which currently includes
support for spell checking, comparing files, viewing CVS ChangeLogs, and
adjusting indentation levels.

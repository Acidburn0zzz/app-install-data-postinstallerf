Comment3='
In a nutshell, NAS is the audio equivalent of an X display server.  The
Network Audio System (NAS) was developed for playing, recording, and
manipulating audio data over a network.  Like the X Window System, it uses the
client/server model to separate applications from the specific drivers that
control audio input and output devices.

Key features of the Network Audio System include
    ? Device-independent audio over the network
    ? Lots of audio file and data formats
    ? Can store sounds in server for rapid replay

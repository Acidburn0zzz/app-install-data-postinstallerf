Comment3='
libdbi implements a database-independent abstraction layer in C, similar to the
DBI/DBD layer in Perl. Writing one generic set of code, programmers can
leverage the power of multiple databases and multiple simultaneous database
connections by using this framework.

The libdbi package contains just the libdbi framework.  To make use of
libdbi you will also need one or more plugins from libdbi-drivers, which
contains the plugins needed to interface to specific database servers.

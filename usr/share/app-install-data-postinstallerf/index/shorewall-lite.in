Shorewall Lite is a companion product to Shorewall that allows network
administrators to centralize the configuration of Shorewall-based
firewalls. Shorewall Lite runs a firewall script generated by a
machine with a Shorewall rule compiler. A machine running Shorewall
Lite does not need to have a Shorewall rule compiler installed.

This is the UPnP MediaServer KIO-slave for the KDE platform. It supports both
browse and search based MediaServers and is able to perform various tasks on
them, including running queries, listing directories and files and allowing
KDE based applications transparent access to them. Being used for Amarok UPnP
support, the slave features many developer friendly features which allow
faster speed or easier handling while compromising on user-friendliness when
used ?under the hood?.

Functionality requires some user-intervention to re-enable the SOLID_UPNP
backend, which is disabled in fedora by default due to many crashes

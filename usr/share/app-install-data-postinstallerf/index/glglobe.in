GLGlobe is an OpenGL - globe simulation for Linux. It was inspired by XGlobe or
XEarth and can use the marker-files of these programs. The simulation includes
day light and night time rendering, and the globe can be rotated and scaled
interactively, or automatically rotated based on the current time of day

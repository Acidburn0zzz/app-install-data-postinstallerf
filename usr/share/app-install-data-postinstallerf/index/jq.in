lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor

 jq is like sed for JSON data ? you can use it to slice
 and filter and map and transform structured data with
 the same ease that sed, awk, grep and friends let you
 play with text.
 It is written in portable C, and it has zero runtime
 dependencies.

Comment3='
This package contains two programs to parse the boot config table (bct)
of Tegra SoC based devices and to generate a new bct with appended
bootloader (e.g. u-boot) read to be flashed to a storage device.
The boot config table is used in the early boot process to setup the sdhci,
DRAM memory controller and also points to the position of the bootloader.

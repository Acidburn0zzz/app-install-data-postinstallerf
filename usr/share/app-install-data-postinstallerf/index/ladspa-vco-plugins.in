Pulse-VCO  Anti-aliased dirac pulse oscillator (flat amplitude spectrum)
Saw-VCO    Anti-aliased sawtooth oscillator (1/F amplitude spectrum)

Both oscillators are based on the same principle of using a
precomputed interpolated dirac pulse. For the sawtooth version, the
edge is made by integrating the anti-aliased pulse. Aliases should
be below -80dB for fundamental frequencies below Fsamp / 6 (i.e. up to
8 kHz at Fsamp = 48 kHz). This frequency range includes the
fundamental frequencies all known musical instruments.

This module allows you to use the GConf configuration system in order to
store/retrieve the configuration of an application. The GConf system is a
powerful configuration manager based on a user daemon that handles a set of
key and value pairs, and notifies any changes of the value to every program
that monitors those keys. GConf is used by GNOME 2.x.

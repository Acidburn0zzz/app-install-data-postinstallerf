MirrorMagic is a game where you shoot around obstacles to collect energy using
your beam. It is similar to "Mindbender" (Amiga) from the same author. The goal
is to work out how to get around obstacles to shoot energy containers with your
beam, thereby opening the path to the next level. Included are many levels
familiar from the games "Deflektor" and "Mindbender".

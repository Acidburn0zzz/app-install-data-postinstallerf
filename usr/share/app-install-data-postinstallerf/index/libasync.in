The Async library is a programming framework that is used to write event driven
applications. It provides abstractions for file descriptor watches, timers,
network communications, serial port communications and config file reading.

Async is written in such a way that it can support other frameworks. Right now
there are two basic frameworks, a simple "select" based implementation and a Qt
implementation. The idea is that advanced libraries can be implemented in such
a way that they only depend on Async. That means that these libraries can be
used in both Qt and pure console applications and in any future frameworks
supported by Async (e.g. Gtk, wxWidgets etc).

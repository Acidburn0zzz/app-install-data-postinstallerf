This module implements a simple approach to creating modules and their support
files, based on the ModuleStarter approach.

When used as a ModuleStarter plugin, this module allows you to specify a
simple directory of templates which are filled in with module-specific
information, and thereafter form the basis of your new module.
The default templates that this module initially provides are based on the
recommendations in the book "Perl Best Practices".

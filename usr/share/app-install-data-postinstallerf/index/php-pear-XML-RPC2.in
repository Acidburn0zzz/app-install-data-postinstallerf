XML_RPC2 is a pear package providing XML_RPC client and server services.
XML-RPC is a simple remote procedure call protocol built using HTTP as
transport and XML as encoding.
As a client library, XML_RPC2 is capable of creating a proxy class which
exposes the methods exported by the server. As a server library, XML_RPC2
is capable of exposing methods from a class or object instance, seamlessly
exporting local methods as remotely callable procedures.

LXSession is a standard-compliant X11 session manager with shutdown/
reboot/suspend support via HAL. In connection with gdm it also supports user
switching.

LXSession is derived from XSM and is developed as default X11 session manager
of LXDE, the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment. Though being part of LXDE,
its totally desktop-independent and only has few dependencies.

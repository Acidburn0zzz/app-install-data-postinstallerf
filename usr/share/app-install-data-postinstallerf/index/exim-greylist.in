Comment3='
This package contains a simple example of how to do greylisting in Exims
ACL configuration. It contains a cron job to remove old entries from the
greylisting database, and an ACL subroutine which needs to be included
from the main exim.conf file.

To enable greylisting, install this package and then uncomment the lines
in Exims configuration /etc/exim.conf which enable it. You need to
the new ACL subroutine, and the line which invokes the new subroutine.

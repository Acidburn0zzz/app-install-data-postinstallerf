Comment3='
This is a very simple DIAMETER client implementation. it does
implement only parts of the base protocol, and is not a complete
DIAMETER implementation.

It is used from other modules with the DI API - i.e. other modules
can execute DI functions to add a server connection, or send a
DIAMETER request.

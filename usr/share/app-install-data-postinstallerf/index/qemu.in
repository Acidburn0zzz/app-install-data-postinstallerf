QEMU is a generic and open source processor emulator which achieves a good
emulation speed by using dynamic translation. QEMU has two operating modes

 * Full system emulation. In this mode, QEMU emulates a full system (for
   example a PC), including a processor and various peripherials. It can be
   used to launch different Operating Systems without rebooting the PC or
   to debug system code.
 * User mode emulation. In this mode, QEMU can launch Linux processes compiled
   for one CPU on another CPU.

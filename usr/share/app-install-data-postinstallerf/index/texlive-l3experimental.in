The l3experimental packages are a collection of experimental
implementations for aspects of the LaTeX3 kernel, dealing with
higher-level ideas such as the Designer Interface. Some of them
work as stand alone packages, providing new functionality, and
can be used on top of LaTeX2e with no changes to the existing
kernel. The present release includes - xgalley, which controls
boxes receiving text for typesetting. - l3dt kernel support
for data tables; - l3regex kernel support for regular
expression search and replace operations; - l3sort kernel
support for sorting sequences, token lists or comma-lists,

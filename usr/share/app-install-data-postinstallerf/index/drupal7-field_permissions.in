The Field Permissions module is a drop-in replacement for the Content
Permissions module shipped with CCK.

It allows site administrators to set field-level permissions to edit or
view CCK fields in any node, and optionally (new feature compared to Content
Permissions module), edit field during node creation, and edit or view
permissions for nodes owned by the current user.
Permissions for each field are not created by default. Instead,
administrators can enable these permissions explicitly for the fields

Pdfposter can be used to create a large poster by building it from multple
pages and/or printing it on large media. It expects as input a PDF file,
normally printing on a single page. The output is again a PDF file, maybe
containing multiple pages together building the poster.  The input page
will be scaled to obtain the desired size.

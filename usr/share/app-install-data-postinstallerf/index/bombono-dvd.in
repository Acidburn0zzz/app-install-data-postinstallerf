Bombono DVD is an easy to use program for making DVD-Video. The main features
are an excellent MPEG viewer with time line, a real WYSIWYG menu editor with
live thumbnails and monitor, and comfortable Drag-N-Drop support. Authoring
to folder, making an ISO-image or burning directly to DVD as well as
re-authoring by importing video from DVD discs is also supported.

This small package replaces \textsuperscript and \textsubscript
commands by equivalent commands that use OpenType font features
to access appropriate glyphs if possible. The package also
patches LaTeXs default footnote command to use this new
\textsuperscript for footnote symbols. The package requires
fontspec running on either XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX. The package
holds functions that were once parts of the xltxtra package,
which now loads realscripts by default.

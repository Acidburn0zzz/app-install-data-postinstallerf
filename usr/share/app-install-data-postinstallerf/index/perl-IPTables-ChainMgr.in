Comment3='
The IPTablesChainMgr package provides an interface to manipulate iptables
policies on Linux systems through the direct execution of iptables
commands. Although making a perl extension of libiptc provided by the iptables
project is possible, it is easy to just execute iptables commands directly in
order to both parse and change the configuration of the policy. Further, this
simplifies installation since the only external requirement is (in the spirit
of scripting) to be able to point IPTablesChainMgr at an installed iptables
binary instead of having to compile against a library.

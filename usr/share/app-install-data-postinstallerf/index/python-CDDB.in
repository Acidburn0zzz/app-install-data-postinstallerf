Comment3='
This is actually a set of three modules to access the CDDB and FreeDB
online databases of audio CD track titles and information. It includes
a C extension module to fetch track lengths under Linux, FreeBSD,
OpenBSD, Mac OS X, Solaris, and Win32, which is easily ported to other
operating systems.

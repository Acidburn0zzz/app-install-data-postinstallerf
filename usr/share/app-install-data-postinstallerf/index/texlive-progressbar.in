This package allows you to easily visualize shares of total
amounts in the form of a bar. So basically you can convert any
number between 0 and 1 to a progressbar using the command
\progressbar{<number>}. Also a lot of customizations are
possible, allowing you to create an unique progressbar on your
own. The package uses TikZ to produce its graphics.

TieEncryptedHash augments Perl hash semantics to build secure, encrypting
containers of data. TieEncryptedHash introduces special hash fields that are

decrypt retrievals at FETCH(). By design, encrypting fields are associated with
keys that begin in single underscore. The remaining keyspace is used for
accessing normal hash fields, which are retained without modification.

While the password is set, a TieEncryptedHash behaves exactly like a standard
Perl hash. This is its transparent mode of access. Encrypting and normal fields
are identical in this mode. When password is deleted, encrypting fields are

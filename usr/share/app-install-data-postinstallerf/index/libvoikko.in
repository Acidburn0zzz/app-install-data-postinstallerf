This is libvoikko, library for spellcheckers and hyphenators using Malaga
natural language grammar development tool. The library is written in C.

Currently only Finnish is supported, but the API of the library has been
designed to allow adding support for other languages later. Note however that
Malaga is rather low level tool that requires implementing the whole morphology
of a language as a left associative grammar. Therefore languages that have
simple or even moderately complex morphologies and do not require morphological
analysis in their hyphenators should be implemented using other tools such as
Hunspell.

Comment3='
This module is a wrapper to the *ssh* executable that is available in
your systems *$PATH*. Use this module to execute commands on the
remote SSH server. It authenticates with the user and password you
passed in the constructors attributes "user" and "password".

Once an ssh connection was started using the "connect()" method it will
remain open until you call the "close()" method. This allows you execute
as many commands as you want with the "exec()" method using only one
connection. This is a better approach over other ssh wrapper
implementations, i.e NetSCP, NetSSH and NetSCPExpect, that

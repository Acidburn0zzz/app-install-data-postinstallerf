Developers Image Library (DevIL) is a programmers library to develop
applications with very powerful image loading capabilities, yet is easy for a
developer to learn and use. Ultimate control of images is left to the
developer, so unnecessary conversions, etc. are not performed. DevIL utilizes
a simple, yet powerful, syntax. DevIL can load, save, convert, manipulate,
filter and display a wide variety of image formats.

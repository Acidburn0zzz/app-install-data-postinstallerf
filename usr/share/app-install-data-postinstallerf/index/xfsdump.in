Comment3='
The xfsdump package contains xfsdump, xfsrestore and a number of
other utilities for administering XFS filesystems.

xfsdump examines files in a filesystem, determines which need to be
backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other
storage medium.	 It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing the
dump of an XFS filesystem, and also knows how to backup XFS extended
attributes.  Backups created with xfsdump are "endian safe" and can
thus be transfered between Linux machines of different architectures
and also between IRIX machines.

ADOdb is an object oriented library written in PHP that abstracts database
operations for portability. It is modelled on Microsofts ADO, but has many
improvements that make it unique (eg. pivot tables, Active Record support,
generating HTML for paging recordsets with next and previous links, cached
recordsets, HTML menu generation, etc).
ADOdb hides the differences between the different databases so you can easily
switch DBs without changing code.

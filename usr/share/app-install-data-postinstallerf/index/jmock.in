Comment3='
Mock objects help you design and test the interactions between the objects in
your programs.
The jMock library
  * makes it quick and easy to define mock objects, so you dont break the
    rhythm of programming.
  * lets you precisely specify the interactions between your objects, reducing
    the brittleness of your tests.
  * works well with the auto-completion and re-factoring features of your IDE
  * plugs into your favorite test framework
  * is easy to extend.

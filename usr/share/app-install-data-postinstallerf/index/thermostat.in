Thermostat is a monitoring and instrumentation tool for the Hotspot JVM,
with support for monitoring multiple JVM instances. The system is made
up of two processes an Agent, which collects data, and a Client which
allows users to visualize this data. These components communicate via
a MongoDB-based storage layer. A pluggable agent and gui framework allows
for collection and visualization of performance data beyond that which is
included out of the box.

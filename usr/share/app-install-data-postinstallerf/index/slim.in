SLiM (Simple Login Manager) is a graphical login manager for X11.
It aims to be simple, fast and independent from the various
desktop environments.
SLiM is based on latest stable release of Login.app by Per Lid?n.

In the distribution, slim may be called through a wrapper, slim-dynwm,
which determines the available window managers using the freedesktop
information and modifies the slim configuration file accordingly,
before launching slim.

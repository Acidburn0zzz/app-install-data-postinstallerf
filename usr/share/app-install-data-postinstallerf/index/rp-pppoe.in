PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) is a protocol used by
many ADSL Internet Service Providers. This package contains the
Roaring Penguin PPPoE client, a user-mode program that does not
require any kernel modifications. It is fully compliant with RFC 2516,
the official PPPoE specification.

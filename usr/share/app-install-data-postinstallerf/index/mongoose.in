Mongoose web server executable is self-sufficient, it does not depend on
anything to start serving requests. If it is copied to any directory and
executed, it starts to serve that directory on port 8080 (so to access files,
go to http//localhost8080). If some additional configuration is required -
for example, different listening port or IP-based access control, then a
mongoose.conf file with respective options can be created in the same
directory where executable lives. This makes Mongoose perfect for all sorts
of demos, quick tests, file sharing, and Web programming.

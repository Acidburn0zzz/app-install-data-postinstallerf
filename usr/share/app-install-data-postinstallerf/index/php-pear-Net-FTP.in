Net_FTP allows you to communicate with FTP servers in a more comfortable
way than the native FTP functions of PHP do. The class implements everything
nativly supported by PHP and additionally features like recursive up- and
downloading, dircreation and chmodding. It although implements an observer
pattern to allow for example the view of a progress bar.

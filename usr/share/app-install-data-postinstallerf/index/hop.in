Hop is a new programming language designed for the Web 2.0. It is a
higher-order language for programming interactive web applications
such as web agendas, web galleries, music players, etc. Hop can be
viewed as a replacement for traditional graphical toolkits. HOP is
implemented as a Web broker, i.e., a Web server that may act
indifferently as a regular Web server or Web proxy.

HOP features
    * an extensive set of widgets for programming fancy GUIs.

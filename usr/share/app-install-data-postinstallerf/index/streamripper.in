Streamripper records shoutcast and icecast compatible streams, in their
native format. The following formats are supported mp3, nsv, aac, and
ogg. The meta data within the stream are interpreted to determine the
beginning and end of each song, and stores the songs on your hard  disk
as individual files. In addition, streamripper includes a relay server
for listening to the station while you are recording.

Comment3='
systemd is a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with
SysV and LSB init scripts. systemd provides aggressive parallelization
capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services,
offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
Linux cgroups, supports snapshotting and restoring of the system
state, maintains mount and automount points and implements an
elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can
work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.

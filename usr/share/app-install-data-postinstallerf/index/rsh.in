The rsh package contains a set of programs which allow users to run
commands on remote machines, login to other machines and copy files
between machines (rsh, rlogin and rcp).  All three of these commands
use rhosts style authentication.  This package contains the clients
needed for all of these services.
The rsh package should be installed to enable remote access to other
machines

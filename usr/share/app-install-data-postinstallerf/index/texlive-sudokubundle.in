The bundle provides three packages - printsudoku, which
provides a command \sudoku whose argument is the name of a file
containing a puzzle specification; - solvesudoku, which
attempts to find a solution to the puzzle in the file named in
the argument; and - createsudoku, which uses the random package
to generate a puzzle according to a bunch of parameters that
the user sets via macros. The bundle comes with a set of ready-
prepared puzzle files.

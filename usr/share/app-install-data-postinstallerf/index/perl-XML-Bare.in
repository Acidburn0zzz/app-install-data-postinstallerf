Comment3='
This module is a Bare XML parser. It is implemented in C. The parser
itself is a simple state engine that is less than 500 lines of C. The
parser builds a C struct tree from input text. That C struct tree is
converted to a Perl hash by a Perl function that makes basic calls back to
the C to go through the nodes sequentially.

Lziprecover is a data recovery tool and decompressor for files in the lzip
compressed data format (.lz) able to repair slightly damaged files, recover
badly damaged files from two or more copies, extract undamaged members
from multi-member files, decompress files and test integrity of files.

Lziprecover is able to recover or decompress files produced by any of the

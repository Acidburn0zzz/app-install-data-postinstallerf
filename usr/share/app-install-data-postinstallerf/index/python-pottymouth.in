PottyMouth transforms completely unstructured and untrusted text to
valid, nice-looking, completely safe XHTML

PottyMouth is designed to handle input text
from non-technical, potentially careless or malicious users
It produces HTML that is completely safe,
programmatically and visually, to include on any web page
And you dont need to make your users read any instructions
before they start typing
They dont even need to know that

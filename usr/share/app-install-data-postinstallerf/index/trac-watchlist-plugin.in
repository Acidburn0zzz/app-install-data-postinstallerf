Comment3='
This plug-in adds a watchlist for wikis and tickets. Every logged-in user can
watch any wikis and ticket and later unwatch it. The watchlist is provided
under [/projectname]/watchlist which is added to the main navigation bar as
soon the user watches something.

This plug-in is still under development. The basic functions are implemented
but the watchlist layout might change in the future. ATM there seems to be
some issues when PostgresSQL is used as DB backend. Therefore the DB table
layout might change in the future. Feel free to test it out and provide
feedback.

The IPTablesParse package provides an interface to parse iptables rules
on Linux systems through the direct execution of iptables commands, or from
parsing a file that contains an iptables policy listing. You can get the
current policy applied to a table/chain, look for a specific user-defined
chain, check for a default DROP policy, or determing whether or not logging
rules exist.

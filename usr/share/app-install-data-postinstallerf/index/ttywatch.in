ttywatch was originally designed to log serial console output from
lots of Linux machines on a single monitor machine.  It handles
log rotation correctly and can be configured both in a configuration
convenience.  It can be set up to allow users to interact via the
network with any of the ports being logged.  It can also log output
in arbitrary ways via modules, which can be built with the
ttywatch-devel package.

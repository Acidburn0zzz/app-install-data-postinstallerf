Store your UNIX user accounts in MySQL. "libnss-mysql" enables the following

* System-wide authentication and name service using a MySQL database.
  Applications do not need to be MySQL-aware or modified in any way.
* Storing authentication information in a database instead of text files.
* Creation of a single authentication database for multiple servers.
  This is often referred to as the "Single Sign-on" problem.

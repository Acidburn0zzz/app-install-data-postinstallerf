QPDF is a command-line program that does structural, content-preserving
transformations on PDF files. It could have been called something
like pdf-to-pdf. It includes support for merging and splitting PDFs
and to manipulate the list of pages in a PDF file. It is not a PDF viewer
or a program capable of converting PDF into other formats.

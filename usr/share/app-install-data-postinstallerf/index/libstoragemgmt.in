Comment3='
The libStorageMgmt library will provide a vendor agnostic open source storage
application programming interface (API) that will allow management of storage
arrays.  The library includes a command line interface for interactive use and
scripting (command lsmcli).  The library also has a daemon that is used for
executing plug-ins in a separate process (lsmd).

Comment3='
The package contains macros for printing various 2/5 bar codes
and Code 39 bar codes. The macros do not use fonts but create
the bar codes directly using vertical rules. It is therefore
possible to vary width to height ratio, ratio of thin and thick
bars. The package is therefore convenient for printing ITF bar
codes as well as bar codes for identification labels for HP
storage media.

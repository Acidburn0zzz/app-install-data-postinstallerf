Bro is an open-source, Unix-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
that passively monitors network traffic and looks for suspicious activity.
Bro detects intrusions by first parsing network traffic to extract is
application-level semantics and then executing event-oriented analyzers that
compare the activity with patterns deemed troublesome. Its analysis includes
detection of specific attacks (including those defined by signatures, but also
those defined in terms of events) and unusual activities (e.g., certain hosts
connecting to certain services, or patterns of failed connection attempts).

GLPI is the Information Resource-Manager with an additional Administration-
Interface. You can use it to build up a database with an inventory for your
company (computer, software, printers...). It has enhanced functions to make
the daily life for the administrators easier, like a job-tracking-system with
mail-notification and methods to build a database with basic information
about your network-topology.

Semantic MediaWiki is also a full-fledged framework, in conjunction with many
spinoff extensions, that can turn a wiki into a powerful and flexible
?collaborative database?. All data created within SMW can easily be published
via the Semantic Web, allowing other systems to use this data seamlessly.

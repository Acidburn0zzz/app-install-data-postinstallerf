Comment3='
MLGMPIDL is an OCaml interface to the GMP and MPFR rational and real
number math libraries. Although there is another such interface, this
one is different in that it provides a more imperative (rather than
functional) interface to conserve memory and that this one uses
CAMLIDL to take care of the C/OCaml interface in a convenient and
modular way.

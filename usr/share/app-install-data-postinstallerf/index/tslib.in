Comment3='
The idea of tslib is to have a core library that provides standardised
services, and a set of plugins to manage the conversion and filtering as
needed.

The plugins for a particular touchscreen are loaded automatically by the
library under the control of a static configuration file, ts.conf.
ts.conf gives the library basic configuration information.  Each line
specifies one module, and the parameters for that module.  The modules
are loaded in order, with the first one processing the touchscreen data
first.

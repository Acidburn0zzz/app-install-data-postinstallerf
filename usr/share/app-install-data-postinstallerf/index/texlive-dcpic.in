DCpic is a package for typesetting Commutative Diagrams within
a LaTeX and TeX documents. Its distinguishing features are a
powerful graphical engine, the PiCTeX package; an easy
specification syntax in which a commutative diagram is
described in terms of its objects and its arrows (morphism),
positioned in a Cartesian coordinate system.

This module provides a clone() method which makes recursive
copies of nested hash, array, scalar and reference types,
including tied variables and objects.

clone() takes a scalar argument and an optional parameter that
can be used to limit the depth of the copy. To duplicate lists,
arrays or hashes, pass them in by reference.

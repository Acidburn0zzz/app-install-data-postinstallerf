Valyria Tear is a free (as meant in the GNU Public License) 2D J-RPG game
based on the Hero of Allacrost engine.

You can play it very much like a typical console role-playing game.
You can explore maps and talk to non-playable characters (NPCs),
fight active-time battles against multiple enemies,
and manage your characters and equipment through a series of menus.
Valyria Tear runs in a series of "game modes" which represent
different states of operation in the game.

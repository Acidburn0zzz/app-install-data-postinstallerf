Comment3='
kitchen includes functions to make gettext easier to use, handling unicode
text easier (conversion with bytes, outputting xml, and calculating how many
columns a string takes), and compatibility modules for writing code that uses
python-2.7 modules but needs to run on python-2.3

This package contains the API documenation for programming with the
kitchen library.

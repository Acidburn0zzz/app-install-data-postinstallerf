Comment3='
This tool automates much of the dirty work when reviewing a package
for the Fedora Package Collection like

    * Downloading SRPM & SPEC.
    * Download upstream source
    * Check md5sums
    * Build and install package in mock.
    * Run rpmlint.
    * Generate a review template, which becomes the starting
      point for the review work.

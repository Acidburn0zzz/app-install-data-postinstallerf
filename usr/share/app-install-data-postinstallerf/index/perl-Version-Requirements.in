Comment3='
VersionRequirements is now DEPRECATED.

Use CPANMetaRequirements, which is a drop-in replacement.
A VersionRequirements object models a set of version constraints like
those specified in the META.yml or META.json files in CPAN distributions.
It can be built up by adding more and more constraints, and it will reduce
them to the simplest representation.

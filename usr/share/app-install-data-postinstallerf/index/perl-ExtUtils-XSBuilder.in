Comment3='
ExtUtilsXSBuilder is a set of modules to parse C header files and create
XS glue code and documentation out of it. Ideally this allows one to "write"
an interface to a C library without coding a line. Since no C-API is ideal,
some adjuments are necessary most of the time. So to use this module you
must still be familiar with C and XS programming, but it removes a lot of
stupid work and copy&paste from you. Also when the C API changes, most
of the time you only have to rerun XSBuilder to get your new Perl API.

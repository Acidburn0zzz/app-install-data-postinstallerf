oxine is a lightweight gui for the famous xine engine which uses the on screen
display functionality of xine to display its user interface elements like
buttons, lists sliders and so on. Due to this, oxine can easily be ported to
any video output device the xine library provides (e.g. frame buffer, dxr3,...)
and is particularly suitable for appliances like set-top boxes, home
entertainment systems or kiosk systems.

Ragel compiles finite state machines from regular languages into executable C,
C++, Objective-C, or D code. Ragel state machines can not only recognize byte
sequences as regular expression machines do, but can also execute code at
arbitrary points in the recognition of a regular language. Code embedding is
done using inline operators that do not disrupt the regular language syntax.

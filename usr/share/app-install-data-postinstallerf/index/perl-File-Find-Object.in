Comment3='
FileFindObject does the same job as FileFind but works like an object
and with an iterator. As FileFind is not object oriented, one cannot
perform multiple searches in the same application. The second problem of
FileFind is its file processing after starting its main loop, one cannot
easily wait for another event and so get the next result.

Comment='<span size="xx-large">"Common sense" Perl defaults</span>'
Comment3='
This module implements some sane defaults for Perl programs, as defined
by two typical (or not so typical - use your common sense) specimens of
Perl coders

Its supposed to be mostly the same, with much lower memory usage, as
	use utf8;
	use strict qw(vars subs);
	use feature qw(say state switch);
	use feature qw(unicode_strings unicode_eval current_sub fc evalbytes);

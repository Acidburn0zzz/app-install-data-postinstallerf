TestAssertions provides a convenient set of tools for constructing tests,
such as unit tests or run-time assertion checks (like Cs ASSERT macro).
Unlike some of the Test modules available on CPAN, TestAssertions is
not limited to unit test scripts; for example it can be used to check
output is as expected within a benchmarking script. When it is used for
unit tests, it generates output in the standard form for CPAN unit testing
(under TestHarness).

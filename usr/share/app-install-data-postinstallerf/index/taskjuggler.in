TaskJuggler is a modern and powerful project management tool. Its new approach
to project planning and tracking is far superior to the commonly used Gantt
chart editing tools. It has already been successfully used in many projects
and scales easily to projects with hundreds of resources and thousands of
tasks. It covers the complete spectrum of project management tasks from the
first idea to the completion of the project. It assists you during project
scoping, resource assignment, cost and revenue planning, and risk and
communication management.

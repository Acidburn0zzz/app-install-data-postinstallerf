Comment3='
This little Perl script tries to detect if it is called from within
a virtualization container. This is detected by looking for well known boot
messages, directories and reading DMI (Desktop Management Interface) data.

The following containers are detected
    * Virtual PC/Virtual Server
    * VirtualBox
    * VMware
    * QEMU/KVM (experimental)

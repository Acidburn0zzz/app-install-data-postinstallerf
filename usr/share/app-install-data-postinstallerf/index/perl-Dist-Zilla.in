DistZilla builds distributions of code to be uploaded to the CPAN. In
this respect, it is like ExtUtilsMakeMaker, ModuleBuild, or
ModuleInstall. Unlike those tools, however, it is not also a system for
installing code that has been downloaded from the CPAN. Since its only run
by authors, and is meant to be run on a repository checkout rather than on
published, released code, it can do much more than those tools, and is free
to make much more ludicrous demands in terms of prerequisites.

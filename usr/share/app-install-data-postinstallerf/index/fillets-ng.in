Comment3='
Fish Fillets is strictly a puzzle game. The goal in every of the
seventy levels is always the same find a safe way out. The fish utter
witty remarks about their surroundings, the various inhabitants of
their underwater realm quarrel among themselves or comment on the
efforts of your fish. The whole game is accompanied by quiet,
comforting music.

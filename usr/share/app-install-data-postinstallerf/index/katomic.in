KAtomic is a fun and educational game built around molecular geometry.
It employs a simplistic two-dimensional look at the elements which
comprise a molecule. A molecule is disassembled into its separate atoms
and scattered around the playing field. The player must reassemble
the molecule in order to complete the current level and move up to
the next one.

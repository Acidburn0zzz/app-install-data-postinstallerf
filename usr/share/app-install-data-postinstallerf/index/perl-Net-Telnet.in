NetTelnet allows you to make client connections to a TCP port and do
network I/O, especially to a port using the TELNET protocol. Simple I/O
methods such as print, get, and getline are provided. More sophisticated
interactive features are provided because connecting to a TELNET port
ultimately means communicating with a program designed for human interaction.
These interactive features include the ability to specify a time-out and to
wait for patterns to appear in the input stream, such as the prompt from a
shell.

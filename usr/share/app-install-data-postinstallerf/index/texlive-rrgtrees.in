Comment3='
A set of LaTeX macros that makes it easy to produce linguistic
tree diagrams suitable for Role and Reference Grammar (RRG).
This package allows the construction of trees with crossing
lines, as is required by this theory for many languages. There
is no known limit on number of tree nodes or levels. Requires
the pst-node and pst-tree LaTeX packages.

Comment='<span size="xx-large">Allows entities to be translated into different languages</span>'
Comment3='
Allows (fieldable) entities to be translated into different languages,
by introducing entity/field translation for the new translatable fields
capability in Drupal 7. Maintained by the Drupal core i18n team.

This project does not replace the Internationalization
(http//drupal.org/project/i18n) project, which focuses on enabling a full
multilingual workflow for site admins/builders. Some features, e.g. content
language negotiation or taxonomy translation, might overlap but most of them
are unrelated.

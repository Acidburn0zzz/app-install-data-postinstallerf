Loook is a simple Python tool that searches for text strings in OpenOffice.org
(and StarOffice 6.0 or later) files. It works under Linux, Windows and
Macintosh. AND, OR and phrase searches are supported. It doesnt create an
index, but searching should be fast enough unless you have really many files.

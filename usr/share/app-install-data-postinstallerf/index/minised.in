Comment3='
This is a smaller, cheaper, faster SED implementation. GNU used to use it,
until they built their own sed around an extended regexp package. For
embedded use we searched for a tiny sed implementation especially for use
with the dietlibc and found Eric S. Raymonds sed implementation quite handy.
Though it suffered several bugs and was not under active maintenance anymore.
After sending a bunch of fixes we agreed to continue maintaining this
lovely, historic sed implementation.

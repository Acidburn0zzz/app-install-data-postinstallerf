The gnuchess package contains the GNU chess program.  By default,
GNU chess uses a curses text-based interface.  Alternatively, GNU chess
can be used in conjunction with the xboard user interface and the X
Window System for play using a graphical chess board.

Install the gnuchess package if you would like to play chess on your
computer.  If youd like to use a graphical interface with GNU chess,
youll also need to install the xboard package and the X Window System.

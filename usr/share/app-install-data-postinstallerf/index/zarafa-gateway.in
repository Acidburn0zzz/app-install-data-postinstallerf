The zarafa-gateway package includes the Zarafa POP3/IMAP Gateway service
to enable regular non-MAPI e-mail clients to connect through POP3 or IMAP
to the Zarafa server to access their e-mails. Using IMAP, it is possible
as well to view the contents of shared folders and subfolders. The Zarafa
POP3/IMAP Gateway service can be configured to listen for POP3, POP3S,
IMAP and/or IMAPS.

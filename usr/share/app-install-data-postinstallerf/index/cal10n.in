Compiler Assisted Localization, abbreviated as CAL10N (pronounced as "calion")
is a java library for writing localized (internationalized) messages.
Features
    * java compiler verifies message keys used in source code
    * tooling to detect errors in message keys
    * native2ascii tool made superfluous, as you can directly encode bundles
      in the most convenient charset, per locale.
    * good performance (300 nanoseconds per key look-up)
    * automatic reloading of resource bundles upon change

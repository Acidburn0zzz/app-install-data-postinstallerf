Gavl is a library for handling and converting uncompressed audio and
video data. It provides datatypes for audio/video formats and standardized
structures to store the data. It supports converting between all formats.
Some conversion functions are available in multiple versions (MMX...),
which are selected by compile time configuration, CPU autodetection and
user options.

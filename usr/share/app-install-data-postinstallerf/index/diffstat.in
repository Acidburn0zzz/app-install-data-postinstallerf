The diff command compares files line by line.  Diffstat reads the
output of the diff command and displays a histogram of the insertions,
deletions and modifications in each file.  Diffstat is commonly used
to provide a summary of the changes in large, complex patch files.

Install diffstat if you need a program which provides a summary of the
diff commands output.

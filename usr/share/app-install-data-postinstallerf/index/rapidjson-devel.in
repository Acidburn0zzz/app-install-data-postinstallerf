Comment3='

RapidJSON is a fast JSON parser and generator for C++.  It was
inspired by RapidXml.
  RapidJSON is small but complete.  It supports both SAX and DOM style
  API. The SAX parser is only a half thousand lines of code.
  RapidJSON is fast.  Its performance can be comparable to strlen().
  It also optionally supports SSE2/SSE4.1 for acceleration.

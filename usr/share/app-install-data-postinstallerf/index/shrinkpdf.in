The simplest shell script in the world to shrink your PDFs
(as in reduce filesize) under Linux with Ghostscript. Inspired
by some code I found in an OpenOffice Python script (I think).
It feeds an existing PDF through Ghostscript, downsamples the
images to 72dpi, and does some other stuff. Pretty straightforward.

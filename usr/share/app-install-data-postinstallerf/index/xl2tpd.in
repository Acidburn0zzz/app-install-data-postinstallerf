Comment3='
xl2tpd is an implementation of the Layer 2 Tunnelling Protocol (RFC 2661).
L2TP allows you to tunnel PPP over UDP. Some ISPs use L2TP to tunnel user
sessions from dial-in servers (modem banks, ADSL DSLAMs) to back-end PPP
servers. Another important application is Virtual Private Networks where
the IPsec protocol is used to secure the L2TP connection (L2TP/IPsec,
RFC 3193). The L2TP/IPsec protocol is mainly used by Windows and
Mac OS X clients. On Linux, xl2tpd can be used in combination with IPsec
implementations such as Openswan.
Example configuration files for such a setup are included in this RPM.

Some projects like a file server need privilege separation to be able to switch
to the connection user and do file operations. uid_wrapper convincingly lies
to the application letting it believe it is operating as root and even
switching between UIDs and GIDs as needed.

To use it set the following environment variables
LD_PRELOAD=libuid_wrapper.so
UID_WRAPPER=1

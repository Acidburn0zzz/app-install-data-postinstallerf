Comment3='
This package contains the highly optimized version of word2vec from
gensim.  It is highly recommend to use this.  If you dont need
the highly optimized version of word2vec, it is sufficient to install
the "python-gensim-core"-package.

Gensim is a Python library for topic modelling, document indexing
and similarity retrieval with large corpora.  Target audience is
the natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval
(IR) community.

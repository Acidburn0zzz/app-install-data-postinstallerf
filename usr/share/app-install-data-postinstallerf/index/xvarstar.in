XVarStar is a astronomical program written for variable star observers, and is
 used for searching GCVS catalogue.  It allows searching by following criteria
-star name
-magnitude
-type
-constellation
-amplitude
-This searching criteria can be combined so one can search for example all
variable stars located in Andromeda constellation and with magnitude
brighter than 5.00.

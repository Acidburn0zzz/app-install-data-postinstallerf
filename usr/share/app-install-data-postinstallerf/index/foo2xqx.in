Comment3='
foo2xqx is an open source printer driver for printers that use the
HP/Software Imaging "XQX" stream wire protocol for their print data,
such as the HP LaserJet M1005 MFP. These printers are often
erroneously referred to as winprinters or GDI printers. However,
Microsoft GDI only mandates the API between an application and the
printer driver, not the protocol on the wire between the printer
driver and the printer. In fact, "XQX" printers are raster printers
which happen to use a very efficient wire protocol which was developed
by HP/Software Imaging. "XQX" is just one of many wire protocols that
are in use today, such as Postscript, PCL, Epson, ZjStream, etc.

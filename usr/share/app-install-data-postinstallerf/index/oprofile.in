OProfile is a profiling system for systems running Linux. The
profiling runs transparently during the background, and profile data
can be collected at any time. OProfile makes use of the hardware performance
counters provided on Intel P6, and AMD Athlon family processors, and can use
the RTC for profiling on other x86 processor types.

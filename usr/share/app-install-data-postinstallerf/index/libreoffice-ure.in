UNO is the component model of LibreOffice. UNO offers interoperability between
programming languages, other components models and hardware architectures,
either in process or over process boundaries, in the Intranet as well as in the
Internet. UNO components may be implemented in and accessed from any
programming language for which a UNO implementation (AKA language binding) and
an appropriate bridge or adapter exists

Comment3='
The ZODB transaction manager is a completely generic transaction manager.  It
can be used independently of the actual "object database" part of ZODB.  One
of the purposes of creating repoze.tm was to allow for systems other than
Zope to make use of two-phase commit transactions in a WSGI context.

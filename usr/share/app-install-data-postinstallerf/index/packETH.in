packETH is a Linux GUI tool that is able to send any packet or sequence of
packets on the Ethernet. It uses the RAW socket option, so it doesnt care
about ip, routing, etc. It is designed to have all the options available,
with all the correct and incorrect values (incorrect means, that user can
send wrong parameters like incorrect checksum, wrong header length, etc.).

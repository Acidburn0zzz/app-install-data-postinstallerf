din is a software musical instrument and audio synthesizer. Bezier
curves are used to draw and sculpt waveforms, create gating and
modulation (FM and AM) patterns, and create delay feedback and volume
patterns. You can also create an unlimited number of drones and sculpt
their waveforms. It uses JACK to output audio, and supports MIDI, OSC
and IRC bot for input. din can be extended and customized with Tcl/Tk
scripts.

The mpage utility takes plain text files or PostScript(TM) documents
as input, reduces the size of the text, and prints the files on a
PostScript printer with several pages on each sheet of paper. Mpage is
very useful for viewing large printouts without using up lots of
paper. Mpage supports many different layout options for the printed
pages.

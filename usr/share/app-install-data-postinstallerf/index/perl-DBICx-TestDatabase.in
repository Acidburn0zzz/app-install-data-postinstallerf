Comment3='
This module creates a temporary SQLite database, deploys your DBIC
schema, and then connects to it. This lets you easily test your DBIC
schema. Since you have a fresh database for every test, you dont have
to worry about cleaning up after your tests, ordering of tests affecting
failure, etc.

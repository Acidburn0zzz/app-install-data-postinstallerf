Translate from Linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas to Buchi automata.
LTL is a type of formal logic that extends formal logic with
qualifiers involving time.
A Buchi automaton is the extension of a finite state automaton
to infinite inputs, and are useful for specifying behavior
of non-terminating systems (such as hardware or operating systems).
A Buchi automaton accepts an infinite input sequence if and only if
there exists a run of the automaton which visits at least one of the
final states infinitely often.

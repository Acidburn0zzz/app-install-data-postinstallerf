Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an
unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations
and full access to internals.

The git rpm installs the core tools with minimal dependencies.  To
install all git packages, including tools for integrating with other
SCMs, install the git-all meta-package.

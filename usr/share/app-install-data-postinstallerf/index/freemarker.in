FreeMarker is a Java tool to generate text output based on templates.
It is designed to be practical as a template engine to generate web
pages and particularly for servlet-based page production that follows
the MVC (Model View Controller) pattern. That is, you can separate the
work of Java programmers and website designers - Java programmers
neednt know how to design nice websites, and website designers neednt
know Java programming.

Comment3='
xhtml2pdf is a html2pdf converter using the ReportLab Toolkit, the HTML5lib
and pyPdf. It supports HTML 5 and CSS 2.1 (and some of CSS 3). It is completely
 written in pure Python so it is platform independent.

The main benefit of this tool that a user with Web skills like HTML and CSS
is able to generate PDF templates very quickly without learning new
technologies.

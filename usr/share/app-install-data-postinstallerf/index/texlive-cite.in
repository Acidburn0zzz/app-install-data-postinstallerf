The package supports compressed, sorted lists of numerical
citations, and also deals with various punctuation and other
issues of representation, including comprehensive management of
break points. The package is compatible with both hyperref and
backref. The package is (unsurprisingly) part of the cite
bundle of the authors citation-related packages.

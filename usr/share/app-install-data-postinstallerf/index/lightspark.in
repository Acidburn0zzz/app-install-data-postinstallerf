Comment3='
Lightspark is a modern, free, open-source flash player implementation.
Lightspark features

* JIT compilation of Actionscript to native x86 byte code using LLVM
* Hardware accelerated rendering using OpenGL Shaders (GLSL)
* Very good and robust support for current-generation Actionscript 3
* A new, clean, code base exploiting Multi-Threading and optimized for
modern hardware. Designed from scratch after the official Flash
documentation was released.

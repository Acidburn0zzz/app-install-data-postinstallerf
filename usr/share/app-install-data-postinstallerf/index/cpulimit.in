cpulimit is a simple program which attempts to limit the CPU usage of a process
(expressed in percentage, not in CPU time). This is useful to control batch
jobs, when you dont want them to eat too much CPU. It does not act on the nice
value or other scheduling priority stuff, but on the real CPU usage. Also, it
is able to adapt itself to the overall system load, dynamically and quickly.

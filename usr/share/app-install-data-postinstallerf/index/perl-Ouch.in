Ouch provides a class for exception handling that doesnt require a
lot of boilerplate, nor any up front definition. If ExceptionClass
is working for you, great! But if you want something that is faster,
easier to use, requires less typing, and has no prerequisites, but still
gives you much of that same functionality, then Ouch is for you.

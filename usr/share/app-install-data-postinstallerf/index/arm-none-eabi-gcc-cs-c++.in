Comment3='
This package contains the Cross Compiling version of g++, which can be used to
compile c++ code for the arm-none-eabi platform, instead of for the native
x86_64 platform.

This package is based on the CodeSourcery 2013.11-24 release,
which includes improved ARM target support compared to the corresponding
GNU GCC release.

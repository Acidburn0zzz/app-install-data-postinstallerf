"Eva" is short for "Entity Views Attachment;" it provides a Views display
plugin that allows the output of a View to be attached to the content of
any Drupal entity. The body of a node or comment, the profile of a user
account, or the listing page for a Taxonomy term are all examples of entity
content.

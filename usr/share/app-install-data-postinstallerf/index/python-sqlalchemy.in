SQLAlchemy is an Object Relational Mappper (ORM) that provides a flexible,
high-level interface to SQL databases.  Database and domain concepts are
decoupled, allowing both sides maximum flexibility and power. SQLAlchemy
provides a powerful mapping layer that can work as automatically or as manually
as you choose, determining relationships based on foreign keys or letting you
define the join conditions explicitly, to bridge the gap between database and
domain.

This package includes the python 2 version of the module.

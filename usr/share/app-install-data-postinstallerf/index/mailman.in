Mailman is software to help manage email discussion lists, much like
Majordomo and Smartmail. Unlike most similar products, Mailman gives
each mailing list a webpage, and allows users to subscribe,
unsubscribe, etc. over the Web. Even the list manager can administer
his or her list entirely from the Web. Mailman also integrates most
things people want to do with mailing lists, including archiving, mail
<-> news gateways, and so on.

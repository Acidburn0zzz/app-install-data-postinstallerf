The APRON library is dedicated to the static analysis of the numerical
variables of a program by Abstract Interpretation.  The aim of such an
analysis is to infer invariants about these variables, like 1<=x+y<=z,
which holds during any execution of the program.

The APRON library is intended to be a common interface to various
underlying libraries/abstract domains and to provide additional services
that can be implemented independently from the underlying
library/abstract domain.

Open Object Rexx is an object-oriented scripting language. The
language is designed for "non-programmer" type users, so it is easy to
learn and easy to use, and provides an excellent vehicle to enter the
world of object-oriented programming without much effort.

It extends the procedural way of programming with object-oriented
features that allow you to gradually change your programming style as
you learn more about objects.

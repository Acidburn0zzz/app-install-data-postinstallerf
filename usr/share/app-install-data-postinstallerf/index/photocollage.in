PhotoCollage allows you to create photo collage posters.  It assembles the
input photographs you give it to generate a big poster.  Photos are arranged
to fill the whole poster, however you can influence the algorithm to change the
final layout.  You can also set a custom border between photos, and save the
generated image in the resolution you want.

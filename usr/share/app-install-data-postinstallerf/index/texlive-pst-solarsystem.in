The package uses pstricks to produce diagrams of the visible
planets, projected on the plane of the ecliptic. It is not
possible to represent all the planets in their real
proportions, so only Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars have their
orbits in correct proportions and their relative sizes are
observed. Saturn and Jupiter are in the right direction, but
not in the correct size.

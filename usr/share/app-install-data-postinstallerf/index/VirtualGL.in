VirtualGL is a toolkit that allows most Unix/Linux OpenGL applications to be
remotely displayed with hardware 3D acceleration to thin clients, regardless
of whether the clients have 3D capabilities, and regardless of the size of the
3D data being rendered or the speed of the network.

Using the vglrun script, the VirtualGL "faker" is loaded into an OpenGL
application at run time.  The faker then intercepts a handful of GLX calls,
which it reroutes to the servers X display (the "3D X Server", which
presumably has a 3D accelerator attached.)  The GLX commands are also
dynamically modified such that all rendering is redirected into a Pbuffer

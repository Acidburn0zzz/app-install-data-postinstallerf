Comment3='
m2vmp2cut is frame accurate (currently PAL) mpeg2 video (m2v file)
with accompanied mp2 audio (mp2 file) cutter.

Frame accuracy is achieved by re-encoding video around cutpoints.
Audio is cut from separate mp2 file at positions that keep a/v sync as
good as possible (maximum sync difference is around 10-15
milliseconds).

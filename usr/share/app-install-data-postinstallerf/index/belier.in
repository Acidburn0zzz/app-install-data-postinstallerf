Belier allows opening a shell or executing a command on a remote computer
through a SSH connection. The main feature of Belier is its ability to cross
several intermediate computers before realizing the job.

* Belier reaches the final computer through intermediate machines.
* You can execute commands with any account available on the remote computer.
* It is possible to switch account on intermediate computers before accessing
  the final computer.
* You can open a data tunnel through every host you cross to the final host.
* Belier generates one script for each final computer to reach.

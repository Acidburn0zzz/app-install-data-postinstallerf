Comment3='
Trang converts between different schema languages for XML.  It
supports the following languages RELAX NG (both XML and compact
syntax), XML 1.0 DTDs, W3C XML Schema.  A schema written in any of the
supported schema languages can be converted into any of the other
supported schema languages, except that W3C XML Schema is supported
for output only, not for input.

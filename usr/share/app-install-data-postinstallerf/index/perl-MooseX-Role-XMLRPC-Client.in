This is a Moose role that provides the methods and attributes needed
to enable a class to serve as an XML-RPC client.  It is parameterized
through MooseXRoleParameterized, so you can customize how it embeds
in your class. You can even embed it multiple times with different
paramaterization, if it strikes your fancy -)

This package provides a parser generator utility that reads a grammar
specification from a file and generates an LR(1) parser for it.  The
parsers consist of a set of LALR(1) parsing tables and a driver
routine written in the C programming language.  It has a public domain
license which includes the generated C.

If you are going to do development on your system, you will want to install
this package.

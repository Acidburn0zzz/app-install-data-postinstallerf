This code forms a set of C++ libraries for multimedia streaming,
using open standard protocols (RTP/RTCP, RTSP, SIP). These
libraries - which can be compiled for Unix (including Linux and Mac OS X),
Windows, and QNX (and other POSIX-compliant systems) - can be used
to build streaming applications.
The libraries can also be used to stream, receive, and process MPEG,
H.263+ or JPEG video, and several audio codecs. They can easily be
extended to support additional (audio and/or video) codecs, and can
also be used to build basic RTSP or SIP clients and servers, and have
been used to add streaming support to existing media player applications.

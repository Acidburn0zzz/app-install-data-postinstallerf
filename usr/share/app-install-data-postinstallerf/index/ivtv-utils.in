The primary goal of the IvyTV Project is to create a kernel driver for
the iTVC15 familiy of MPEG codecs. The iTVC15 family includes the
iTVC15 (CX24315) and iTVC16 (CX24316). These chips are commonly found
on Hauppauges WinTV PVR-250 and PVR-350 TV capture cards.

The driver has made it into the kernel so this package only contains
some userland tools for ivtv.

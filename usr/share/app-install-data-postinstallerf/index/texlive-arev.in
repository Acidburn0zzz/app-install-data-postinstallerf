The package arev provides type 1 and virtual fonts, together
with LaTeX packages for using Arev Sans in both text and
mathematics. Arev Sans is a derivative of Bitstream Vera Sans
created by Tavmjong Bah, adding support for Greek and Cyrillic
characters. Bah also added a few variant letters that are more
appropriate for mathematics. The primary purpose for using Arev
Sans in LaTeX is presentations, particularly when using a
computer projector. In such a context, Arev Sans is quite
readable, with large x-height, "open letters", wide spacing,
and thick stems. The style is very similar to the SliTeX font

Kohana is an elegant HMVC PHP5 framework that provides a rich set of
components for building web applications.
It requires very little configuration, fully supports UTF-8 and i18n,
and provides many of the tools that a developer needs within a highly
flexible system. The integrated class auto-loading, cascading file system,
highly consistent API, and easy integration with vendor libraries make
it viable for any project, large or small.

Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is similar to memcached but the data
set is not volatile, and values can be strings, exactly like in memcached, but
also lists, sets, and ordered sets. All this data types can be manipulated with
atomic operations to push/pop elements, add/remove elements, perform server side
union, intersection, difference between sets, and so forth. Redis supports
different kind of sorting abilities.

Qemu-sanity-check is a short shell script that test-boots a Linux
kernel under qemu, making sure it boots up to userspace.  The idea is
to test the Linux kernel and/or qemu to make sure they are working.

Most users should install the qemu-sanity-check package.
If you are testing qemu or the kernel in those packages and you want
to avoid a circular dependency on qemu or kernel, you should use
BuildRequires qemu-sanity-check-nodeps instead.

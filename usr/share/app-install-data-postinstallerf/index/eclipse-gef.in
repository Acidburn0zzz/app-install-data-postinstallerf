The Graphical Editing Framework (GEF) allows developers to create a rich
graphical editor from an existing application model. GEF is completely
application neutral and provides the groundwork to build almost any
application, including but not limited to activity diagrams, GUI builders,
class diagram editors, state machines, and even WYSIWYG text editors.

The package provides commands to define enumerable items with a
number and a long name, which can be referenced referenced
later with the name or just the short form. For instance,
"Milestone M1 Specification created" can be defined and later
on be referenced with M1 or M1 ("Specification created").
The text in the references is derived from the definition and
also rendered as hyperlink to the definition.

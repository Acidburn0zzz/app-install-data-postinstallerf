amavisd-new is a high-performance and reliable interface between mailer
(MTA) and one or more content checkers virus scanners, and/or
MailSpamAssassin Perl module. It is written in Perl, assuring high
reliability, portability and maintainability. It talks to MTA via (E)SMTP
or LMTP, or by using helper programs. No timing gaps exist in the design
which could cause a mail loss.

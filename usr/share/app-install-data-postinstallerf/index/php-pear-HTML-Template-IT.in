The Isotemplate API is somewhat tricky for a beginner although it is the
best one you can build.

Source and target can be block names or even handler names. This API gives
you a maximum of flexibility but you always have to know what you do which
is quite unusual for php developer like me.
If all blocks are within one file, the script knows how they are nested and
in which way you have to parse them. IT knows that inner1 is a child of
block2, theres no need to tell him about this.

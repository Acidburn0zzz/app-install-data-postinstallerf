pa-applet is a systray-applet that allows you to control some of
PulseAudios features. More specifically, pa-applet allows you to control
the volume level of the default sink and mute or unmute it. It also allows you
to change the active profile of the default sink, which can be useful to tell
PulseAudio to redirect audio to the HDMI output instead of outputting to the
built-in speakers in a computer connected to an HDMI device.

NetDaemon is an abstract base class for implementing portable server
applications in a very simple way. The module is designed for Perl 5.006 and
ithreads (and higher), but can work with fork() and Perl 5.004.

The NetDaemon class offers methods for the most common tasks a daemon
needs Starting up, logging, accepting clients, authorization, restricting
its own environment for security and doing the true work. You only have to
override those methods that arent appropriate for you, but typically
inheriting will safe you a lot of work anyways.

Comment3='
A perl module for context-sensitive phonetic string replacement to modify
strings according to predefined replacement rules in such a way that words
with the same pronunciation (e.g. "tail" and "tale") are converted to the
same string. This can, for example, be used to implement error-tolerant
search routines in address databases. It contains phonetic rules for German
only, but the software has been prepared for multi-language support.

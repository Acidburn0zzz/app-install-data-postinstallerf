POPFile is an automatic mail classification tool. Once properly set up
and trained, it will scan all email as it arrives and classify it
based on your training. You can give it a simple job, like separating
out junk e-mail, or a complicated one-like filing mail into a dozen
folders. Think of it as a personal assistant for your inbox.

Comment3='
Lsyncd watches a local directory trees event monitor interface (inotify).
It aggregates and combines events for a few seconds and then spawns one
(or more) process(es) to synchronize the changes. By default this is
rsync.

Lsyncd is thus a light-weight live mirror solution that is comparatively
easy to install not requiring new file systems or block devices and does
not hamper local file system performance.

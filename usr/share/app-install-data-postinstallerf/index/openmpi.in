Open MPI is an open source, freely available implementation of both the
MPI-1 and MPI-2 standards, combining technologies and resources from
several other projects (FT-MPI, LA-MPI, LAM/MPI, and PACX-MPI) in
order to build the best MPI library available.  A completely new MPI-2
compliant implementation, Open MPI offers advantages for system and
software vendors, application developers, and computer science
researchers. For more information, see http//www.open-mpi.org/ .

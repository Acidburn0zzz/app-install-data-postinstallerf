Arundina fonts were created aiming at Bitstream Vera / Dejavu
compatibility, under SIPAs initiation.  They were then further
modified by TLWG for certain aspects, such as Latin glyph size
compatibility and OpenType conformance.
This package consists of the Thai Arundina sans-serif monospace font
faces.

par2cmdline is a program for creating and using PAR2 files to detect damage
in data files and repair them if necessary. PAR2 files are usually
published in binary newsgroups on Usenet; they apply the data-recovery
capability concepts of RAID-like systems to the posting and recovery of
multi-part archives.

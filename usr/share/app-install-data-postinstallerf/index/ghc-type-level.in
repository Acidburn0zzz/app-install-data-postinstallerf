This library permits performing computations on the type-level.
Type-level functions are implemented using functional dependencies of
multiparameter type classes. To date, Booleans and Numerals
(Naturals and Positives) are supported. With regard to Numerals,
there is support for common arithmetic operations (addition, substraction,
multiplication,division, exponientation, logarithm, maximum, comparison, GCD)
over natural numbers (using a decimal representation to make compile-time
errors friendlier).  For a tutorial on type-level numerals and how to use
them to implement numerically-parameterized vectors see
<http//www.ict.kth.se/forsyde/files/tutorial/tutorial.html#FSVec>.

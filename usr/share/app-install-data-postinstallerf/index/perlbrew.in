perlbrew is a program to automate the building and installation of perl in
the users HOME. At the moment, it installs everything to ~/perl5/perlbrew,
and requires you to tweak your PATH by including a bashrc/cshrc file it
provides. You then can benefit from not having to run sudo commands to
install cpan modules because those are installed inside your HOME too. Its
almost like an isolated perl environments.

Comment3='
A development of TeX, which deals in multi-octet Unicode
characters, to enable native treatment of a wide range of
languages without changing character-set. Work on Omega seems,
more or less, to have ceased its immediate successor was to be
the aleph project (though that too has stalled). Projects
developing Omega (and Aleph) ideas include Omega-2 and LuaTeX.

The mathspec package provides an interface to typeset
mathematics in XeLaTeX with arbitrary text fonts using fontspec
as a backend. The package is under development and later
versions might to be incompatible with this version, as this
version is incompatible with earlier versions. The package
requires at least version 0.9995 of XeTeX.

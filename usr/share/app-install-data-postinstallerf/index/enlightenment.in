Enlightenment window manager is a lean, fast, modular and very extensible window
manager for X11 and Linux. It is classed as a "desktop shell" providing the
things you need to operate your desktop (or laptop), but is not a whole 
application suite. This covered launching applications, managing their windows
and doing other system tasks like suspending, reboots, managing files etc.

Comment3='
Gitter allows you to interact in an object oriented manner with Git repositories
via PHP. The main goal of the library is not to replace the system git command,
but provide a coherent, stable and performatic object oriented interface.

Most commands are sent to the systems git command, parsed and then interpreted
by Gitter. Everything is transparent to you, so you dont have to worry about a
thing.

OCaml is a high-level, strongly-typed, functional and object-oriented
programming language from the ML family of languages.

This package comprises two batch compilers (a fast bytecode compiler
and an optimizing native-code compiler), an interactive toplevel system,
parsing tools (Lex,Yacc,Camlp4), a replay debugger, a documentation generator,
and a comprehensive library.

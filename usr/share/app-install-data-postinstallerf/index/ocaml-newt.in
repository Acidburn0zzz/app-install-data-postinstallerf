This is a set of OCaml bindings to newt.

The newt windowing system is a terminal-based window and widget
library designed for writing applications with a simple, but
user-friendly, interface.  While newt is not intended to provide the
rich feature set advanced applications may require, it has proven to
be flexible enough for a wide range of applications (most notably, Red
Hats installation process).

Comment3='
The glibc-headers package contains the header files necessary
for developing programs which use the standard C libraries (which are
used by nearly all programs).  If you are developing programs which
will use the standard C libraries, your system needs to have these
standard header files available in order to create the
executables.

Install glibc-headers if you are going to develop programs which will
use the standard C libraries.

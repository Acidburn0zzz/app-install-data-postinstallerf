Produce Encapsulated PostScript Files (EPS/EPSF) from a one-
page PostScript document, or any PostScript document. A correct
Bounding Box is calculated for the EPS files and some
PostScript command sequences that can produce errorneous
results on printers are filtered. The input is cropped to
include just the image contained in the PostScript file. The
EPS files can then be included into TeX documents. Other
programs like ps2epsi (a script distributed with ghostscript)
dont always calculate the correct bounding box (because the
values are put on the PostScript stack which may get corrupted

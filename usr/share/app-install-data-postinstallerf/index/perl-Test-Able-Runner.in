I like TestAble. I really dont like having to copy my boilerplate test
runner and modify it when I use it in a new project. This provides a basic
test runner for your testable tests that takes care of the basics for you.
You can extend it a bit to customize things if you like as well. Let me
know if you want this to do something else.

Comment3='
S-Lang is an interpreted language and a programming library.  The
S-Lang language was designed so that it can be easily embedded into
a program to provide the program with a powerful extension language.
The S-Lang library, provided in this package, provides the S-Lang
extension language.  S-Langs syntax resembles C, which makes it easy
to recode S-Lang procedures in C if you need to.

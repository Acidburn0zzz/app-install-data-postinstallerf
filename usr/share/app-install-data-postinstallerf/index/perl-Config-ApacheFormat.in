This module is designed to parse a configuration file in the same syntax used by
the Apache web server (see http//httpd.apache.org for details). This allows you
to build applications which can be easily managed by experienced Apache admins.
Also, by using this module, youll benefit from the support for nested blocks
with built-in parameter inheritance. This can greatly reduce the amount or
repeated information in your configuration files.

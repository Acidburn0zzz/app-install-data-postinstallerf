pygtkChart is a Python package that provides PyGTK widgets to simply
integrate charts into a GTK application. Currently pygtkChart comes
with four widgets

- BarChart - shows a bar chart (see example on the right)
- MultiBarChart - like BarChart, but shows groups of bars
- PieChart - shows simple pie charts
The appearance of the widgets is highly customable. All bars, graphs,
or titles on a chart can be accessed and modified separately.

Phatch is a simple to use cross-platform GUI Photo Batch Processor
which handles all popular image formats and can duplicate
(sub)folder hierarchies. Phatch can batch re-size, rotate,
apply perspective, shadows, rounded corners, ...
and more in minutes instead of hours or days if you do it manually.
Phatch allows you to use EXIF and IPTC tags for renaming
and data stamping. Phatch also supports a console version
to batch photos on web-servers.

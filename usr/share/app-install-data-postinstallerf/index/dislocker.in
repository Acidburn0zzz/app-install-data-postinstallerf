Dislocker has been designed to read BitLocker encrypted partitions ("drives")
under a Linux system. The driver used to only read volumes encrypted under a
Microsoft Windows 7 system but is now Microsoft Windows Vista capable and has
the write functionality.

The file name where the BitLocker encrypted partition will be decrypted needs
to be given. This may take a long time, depending on the size of the encrypted
partition. But afterward, once the partition is decrypted, the access to the
NTFS partition will be faster than with FUSE. Another thing to think about is
the size of the disk (same size as the volume that is tried to be decrypted).

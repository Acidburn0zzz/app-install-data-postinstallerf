fpack optimally compresses FITS format images and funpack restores them
to the original state.

* Integer format images are losslessly compressed using the Rice
compression algorithm.
    * typically 30% better compression than GZIP
    * about 3 times faster compression speed than GZIP
    * about the same uncompression speed as GUNZIP
* Floating-point format images are compressed with a lossy algorithm

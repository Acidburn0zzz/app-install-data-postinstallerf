Comment3='
This module allows overriding the system-defined character case changing
functions. Any time something in its lexical scope would ordinarily call
lc(), lcfirst(), uc(), or ucfirst() the corresponding user-specified
function will instead be called. This applies to direct calls, and indirect
calls via the \L, \l, \U, and \u escapes in double quoted strings and
regular expressions.

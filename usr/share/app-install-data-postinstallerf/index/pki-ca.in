The Certificate Authority (CA) is a required PKI subsystem which issues,
renews, revokes, and publishes certificates as well as compiling and
publishing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).

The Certificate Authority can be configured as a self-signing Certificate
Authority, where it is the root CA, or it can act as a subordinate CA,
where it obtains its own signing certificate from a public CA.
This package is one of the top-level java-based Tomcat PKI subsystems
provided by the PKI Core used by the Certificate System.

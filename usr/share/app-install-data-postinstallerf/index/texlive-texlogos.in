TeXlogos defines an assortment of frequently used logos not
contained in base LaTeX itself. The MetaFont, MetaPost, AMS,
BibTeX and SliTeX logos are defined, as long as you have the
appropriate CM/Logo/AMS fonts. Currency symbols Euro, Cent,
Yen, Won and Naira are defined so as not to need TS1-encoded
fonts. Also defined are the C++ logo, with the + signs
properly positioned, and the logo of the Vienna University
Business Administration Center (BWZ).

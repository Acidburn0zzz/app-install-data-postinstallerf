txt2rss is a shell script that parses a simple txt file (in a simple
format) and convert it to RSS feed file. Simple to use and intuitive,
you need to set up a config file with parameter like webmasters name,
link of the site and others, after you just call the script with
options like <input file> and a <output file>.

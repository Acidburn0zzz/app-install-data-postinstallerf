It is a common feature of applications (whether run directly, or via the Web)
to an English-speaker, a German interface to a German-speaker, and so on for
all languages its programmed with. LocaleMaketext is a framework for
software localization; it provides you with the tools for organizing and
accessing the bits of text and text-processing code that you need for
producing localized applications.

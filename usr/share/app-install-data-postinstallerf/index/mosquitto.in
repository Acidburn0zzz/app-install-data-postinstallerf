Mosquitto is an open source (BSD licensed) message broker that implements the
MQ Telemetry Transport protocol version 3.1. MQTT provides a lightweight
method of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe model. This makes
it suitable for "machine to machine" messaging such as with low power sensors
or mobile devices such as phones, embedded computers or micro-controllers
like the Arduino.

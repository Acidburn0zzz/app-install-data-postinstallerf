Comment='<span size="xx-large">GnuTLS module for the Apache HTTP server</span>'
Comment3='
mod_gnutls uses the GnuTLS library to provide SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1
encryption for Apache HTTPD.  It is similar to mod_ssl in purpose, but does
not use OpenSSL.  A primary benefit of using this module is the ability to
configure multiple SSL certificates for a single IP-address/port combination
(useful for securing virtual hosts).

Features
    * Support for SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1.
    * Support for client certificates.
    * Support for RFC 5081 OpenPGP certificate authentication.

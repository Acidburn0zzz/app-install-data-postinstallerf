ZMap is an open-source network scanner that enables researchers to easily
perform Internet-wide network studies. With a single machine and a well
provisioned network uplink, ZMap is capable of performing a complete scan of
the IPv4 address space in under 45 minutes, approaching the theoretical limit
of gigabit Ethernet.

ZMap can be used to study protocol adoption over time, monitor service
availability, and help us better understand large systems distributed across
the Internet.

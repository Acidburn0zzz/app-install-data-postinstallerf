This is Eddie Saudraiss font esint10 in Adobe Type 1 format.
The Adobe Type 1 implementation was generated from the original
MetaFont using mftrace. This distribution does not contain the
TFM files that are necessary to use the fonts with TeX; the TFM
files can be generated from the Metafont sources obtained by
following the instructions in the normal way.

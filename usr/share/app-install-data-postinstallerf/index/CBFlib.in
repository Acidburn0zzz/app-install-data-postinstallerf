CBFlib (Crystallographic Binary File library) is a library of ANSI-C
functions providing a simple mechanism for accessing Crystallographic
Binary Files (CBF files) and Image-supporting CIF (imgCIF) files. The
CBFlib API is loosely based on the CIFPARSE API for mmCIF files. Like
CIFPARSE, CBFlib does not perform any semantic integrity checks;
rather it simply provides functions to create, read, modify and write
CBF binary data files and imgCIF ASCII data files.

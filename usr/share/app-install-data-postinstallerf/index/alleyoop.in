Comment3='
Alleyoop is a graphical front-end to the increasingly popular Valgrind
memory checker for x86 GNU/ Linux using the Gtk+ widget set and other
GNOME libraries for the X Windows System.

Features include a right-click context menu to intelligently suppress
errors or launch an editor on the source file/jumping to the exact
line of the error condition. A searchbar at the top of the viewer can
be used to limit the viewable errors to those that match the regex
criteria entered. Also included is a fully functional Suppressions
editor.

VMPK is a MIDI event generator/receiver. It doesnt produce any sound by
itself, but can be used to drive a MIDI synthesizer (either hardware or
software, internal or external). You can use the computers keyboard to play
MIDI notes, and also the mouse. You can use the Virtual MIDI Piano Keyboard to
display the played MIDI notes from another instrument or MIDI file player.

This package is compiled with JACK driver.

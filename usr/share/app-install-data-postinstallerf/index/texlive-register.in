This package is designed for typesetting the programmable
elements in digital hardware, i.e., registers. Such registers
typically have many fields and can be quite wide; they are thus
a challenge to typeset in a consistent manner. Register is
similar in some aspects to the bytefield package. Anyone doing
hardware documentation using LaTeX should examine both
packages. Register requires a fairly recent version of the
float package. A Perl module and a Perl script are provided, to
translate the register specifications into programmable data
structures.

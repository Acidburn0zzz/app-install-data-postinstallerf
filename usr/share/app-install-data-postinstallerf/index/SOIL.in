SOIL is a tiny C library used primarily for uploading textures into OpenGL. It
is based on stb_image version 1.16, the public domain code from Sean Barrett.
The author has extended it to load TGA and DDS files, and to perform common
functions needed in loading OpenGL textures. SOIL can also be used to save and
load images in a variety of formats (useful for loading height maps, non-OpenGL
applications, etc.)

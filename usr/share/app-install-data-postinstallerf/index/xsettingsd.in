xsettingsd is a daemon that implements the XSETTINGS specification.

It is intended to be small, fast, and minimally dependent on other libraries.
It can serve as an alternative to gnome-settings-daemon for users who are not
using the GNOME desktop environment but who still run GTK+ applications and
want to configure things such as themes, font anti-aliasing/hinting, and UI
sound effects.

Comment3='
The "mro" namespace provides several utilities for dealing with method
resolution order and method caching in general in Perl 5.9.5 and higher.
This module provides those interfaces for earlier versions of Perl (back
to 5.6.0 anyways).

It is a harmless no-op to use this module on 5.9.5+. That is to say,
code which properly uses MROCompat will work unmodified on both older
Perls and 5.9.5+.
If youre writing a piece of software that would like to use the parts

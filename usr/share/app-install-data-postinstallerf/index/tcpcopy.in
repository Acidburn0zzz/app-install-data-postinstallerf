tcpcopy can help you find bugs without deploying your server software on your
production servers. It can also be used to do smoke testing. For example, when
you want to migrate from Apache to Nginx, tcpcopy can help you test it. Apache
is running online, while tcpcopy can copy the TCP flows from Apache to Nginx.
To Nginx, the TCP flows are just forwarding to it. This will not affect Apache
at all except cost a little network bandwidth and CPU load.

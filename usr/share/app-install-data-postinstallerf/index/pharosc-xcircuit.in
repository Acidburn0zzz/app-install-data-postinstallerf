VLSI and ASIC Technology Standard Cell Libraries for XCircuit.
The schematic symbol library (in vlsi_lib.lps) has been set up so
that each transistor shows its width in lambda, with a transistor
length of 2 lambda being assumed by default.

In the /usr/share/pharosc/xcircuit/cells/vsclib directory, the .ps
files are the schematics; the .spc files are the Spice decks
written from xcircuit; and the .spi files are the .spc files
packaged into a subcircuit. These subcircuits are copied into
/usr/share/pharosc/xcircuit/subckt/vsclib.

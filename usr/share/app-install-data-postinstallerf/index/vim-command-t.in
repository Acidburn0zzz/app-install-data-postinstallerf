The Command-T plug-in for VIM provides an extremely fast, intuitive mechanism
for opening files with a minimal number of keystrokes. Its named "Command-T"
because it is inspired by the "Go to File" window bound to Command-T
in TextMate.

Files are selected by typing characters that appear in their paths, and are
ordered by an algorithm which knows that characters that appear in certain
locations (for example, immediately after a path separator) should be given
more weight.

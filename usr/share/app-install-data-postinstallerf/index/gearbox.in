Gearbox provides a collection of usable peer-reviewed robotics-related
libraries. Gearbox is not an integration framework. It provides a set
of implementations, without insisting on a standard API, for use by
any number of existing frameworks.  Gearbox includes cross-platform
libraries to communicate over TCP, UDP, and serial, and implements the
communication protocols of many popular sensors.

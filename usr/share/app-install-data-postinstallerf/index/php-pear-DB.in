DB is a database abstraction layer providing
* an OO-style query API
* portability features that make programs written for one DBMS work with
  other DBMSs
* a DSN (data source name) format for specifying database servers
* prepare/execute (bind) emulation for databases that dont support it natively
* a result object for each query response
* portable error codes
* sequence emulation
* sequential and non-sequential row fetching as well as bulk fetching

Simple-JNDI is intended to solve two problems. The first is
that of finding a container independent way of opening a
database connection, the second is to find a good way of
specifying application configurations.
1. Unit tests or prototype code often need to emulate the
  environment within which the code is expected to run.
  A very common one is to get an object of type
  javax.sql.DataSource from JNDI so a java.sql.Connection
  to your database of choice may be opened.
2. Applications need configuration; a JNDI implementation

Comment3='
Typeset footnotes in run-on paragraphs, instead of one above
another; this is a re-seating, for the LaTeX environment, of an
example in the TeXbook. The same basic code, improved for use
in e-TeX-based LaTeX, appears in the comprehensive footnote
package footmisc, and superior versions are also available in
the manyfoot and bigfoot packages.

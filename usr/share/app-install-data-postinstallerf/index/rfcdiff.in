Comment3='
The purpose of this program is to compare two versions of an
internet-draft, and as output produce a diff in one of several
formats
- side-by-side html diff
- paged wdiff output in a text terminal
- a text file with changebars in the left margin
- a simple unified diff output

In all cases, internet-draft headers and footers are stripped before
generating the diff, to produce a cleaner diff.

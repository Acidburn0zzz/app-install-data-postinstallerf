The package provides the command \Figure[<key=value>...]{<image
filename>} to simplify the business of including an image as
figure in the most common form (centred and with caption and
label). Caption and label are set using the caption and label
keys; the label fig<image filename> is used if none is given.
If the here key is given, the figure is not floated, and the
user is responsible for placement. The package uses the
authors package adjustbox to centre an image and to simplify
further modifications.

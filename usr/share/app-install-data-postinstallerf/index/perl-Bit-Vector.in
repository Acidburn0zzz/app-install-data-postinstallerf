BitVector is an efficient C library which allows you to handle bit
vectors, sets (of integers), "big integer arithmetic" and boolean
matrices, all of arbitrary sizes.

The library is efficient (in terms of algorithmical complexity) and
therefore fast (in terms of execution speed) for instance through the
widespread use of divide-and-conquer algorithms.

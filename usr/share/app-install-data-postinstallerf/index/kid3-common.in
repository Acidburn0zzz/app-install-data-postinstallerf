If you want to easily tag multiple MP3, Ogg/Vorbis, FLAC, MPC,
MP4/AAC, MP2, Speex, TrueAudio, WavPack, WMA, WAV, and AIFF files
(e.g. full albums) without typing the same information again and again
and have control over both ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags, then Kid3 is the
program you are looking for.  The kid3-common package provides Kid3
command line tool and files shared between all Kid3 variants.

This library provides interface for recording and replaying events in ROOT.
Recorded events are
 - Commands typed by user in command line (new TCanvas)
 - GUI events (mouse movement, button clicks, ...)
All the recorded events from one session are stored in one TFile
and can be replayed again anytime.

The Composite extension causes a entire sub-tree of the window
hierarchy to be rendered to an off-screen buffer. Applications can
then take the contents of that buffer and do whatever they like. The
off-screen buffer can be automatically merged into the parent window
or merged by external programs, called compositing managers.

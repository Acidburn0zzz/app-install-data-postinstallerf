skf is an i18n-capable kanji filter. skf is designed for
reading documents in various languages and codes using kanji
or unicode capable display devices. Like other kanji filters,
skf provides basic Japanese kanji code conversion features,
include to/from JIS, EUC, Shift-JIS, UCS2, KEIS83 and UTF-7/8,
but also support various international codesets include Korian
and Chinese standard codesets.

Unlike nkf, skf does not provide additional fancy features
like broken jis recovery, but it has support for ISO-8859s,

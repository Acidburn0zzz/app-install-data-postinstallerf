Comment3='
Ice is a modern alternative to object middleware such as CORBA or
COM/DCOM/COM+.  It is easy to learn, yet provides a powerful network
infrastructure for demanding technical applications. It features an
object-oriented specification language, easy to use C++, C#, Java,
Python, Ruby, PHP, and Visual Basic mappings, a highly efficient
protocol, asynchronous method invocation and dispatch, dynamic
transport plug-ins, TCP/IP and UDP/IP support, SSL-based security, a
firewall solution, and much more.

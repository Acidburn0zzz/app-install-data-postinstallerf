A collection of verbatim facilities that provide line-numbered
verbatim, verbatim that obeys TAB characters, verbatim input
and verbatim output to file. The package makes use of the LaTeX
required verbatim package. The package formed from a series of
small pieces, and is somewhat unstructured. The user who looks
for thought-through verbatim facilities is advised to consider
using the fancyvrb package in place of moreverb.

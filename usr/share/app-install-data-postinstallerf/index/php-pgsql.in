The php-pgsql package add PostgreSQL database support to PHP.
PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management
system that supports almost all SQL constructs. PHP is an
HTML-embedded scripting language. If you need back-end support for
PostgreSQL, you should install this package in addition to the main
php package.

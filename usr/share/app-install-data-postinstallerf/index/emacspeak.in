Emacspeak is a speech interface that allows visually impaired users to
interact independently and efficiently with the computer. Emacspeak has
dramatically changed how the author and hundreds of blind and visually
impaired users around the world interact with the personal computer and
the Internet. A rich suite of task-oriented speech-enabled tools provides
efficient speech-enabled access to the evolving semantic WWW.

The Pidgin-Rhythmbox plugin will automatically update your Pidgin user and
status info with the currently playing music in Rhythmbox.

If the artist and title are known, it will also attempt to create a link to
the songs lyrics by using Googles "Im Feeling Lucky" feature.
Pidgin-Rhythmbox will replace %rb in your user info and status message with
the song information.

CLucene is a C++ port of the popular Apache Lucene search engine
(http//lucene.apache.org/java).
CLucene aims to be a high-speed alternative to Java Lucene, its API is very
similar to that of the Java version. CLucene has recently been brought up to
date with Lucene 2.3.2. It contains most of the same functionality as the Java version.

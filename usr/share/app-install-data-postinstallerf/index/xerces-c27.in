Xerces-C is a validating XML parser written in a portable subset of C++.
Xerces-C makes it easy to give your application the ability to read and write
XML data. A shared library is provided for parsing, generating, manipulating,
and validating XML documents. Xerces-C is faithful to the XML 1.0
recommendation and associated standards ( DOM 1.0, DOM 2.0. SAX 1.0, SAX 2.0,
Namespaces).

Note that this package contains Xerces-C++ 2.7.0 for compatibility with
applications that cannot use a newer version.

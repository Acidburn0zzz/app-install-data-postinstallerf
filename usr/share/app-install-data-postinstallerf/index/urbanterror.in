Urban Terror could best be described as a Hollywood tactical shooter; it is
realism based to a certain extent (environments/weapons/player models), but
also goes by the motto "fun over realism" (fast gameplay and lots of action).
This combination of reality and action results in a very unique, enjoyable
and addictive game.

Urban Terror uses the GPL licensed ioquake3 engine, however the Urban Terror
datafiles are not freely redistributable. This package will install an Urban
Terror menu entry, which will automatically download the necessary datafiles
(700 MB!) the first time you start Urban Terror.

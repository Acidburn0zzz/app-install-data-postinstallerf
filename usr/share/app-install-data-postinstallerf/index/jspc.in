The Codehaus is a collaborative environment for building open source
projects with a strong emphasis on modern languages, focused on
quality components that meet real world needs.

Provides support to precompile your JSPs and have them included into
pluggable JSP compiler implementation, which currently allows different
versions of the Tomcat Jasper compiler to be used as needed.

Urwid is a Python library for making text console applications.  It has
many features including fluid interface resizing, support for UTF-8 and
CJK encodings, standard and custom text layout modes, simple markup for
setting text attributes, and a powerful, dynamic list box that handles a
mix of widget types.  It is flexible, modular, and leaves the developer in
control.

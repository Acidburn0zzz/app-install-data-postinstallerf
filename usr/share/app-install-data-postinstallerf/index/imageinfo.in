ImageInfo computes and displays selected image attributes. It is
similar in function to the ImageMagick "identify" utility, but
provides a few additional attributes (such as details of embedded ICC
profiles), and allows command line selection of the attributes to be
computed, avoiding unnecessary computation and and allowing easier
parsing of results when this utility is called from a script.

LatencyTOP is a tool for software developers (both kernel and userspace), aimed
at identifying where in the system latency is happening, and what kind of
operation/action is causing the latency to happen so that the code can be
changed to avoid the worst latency hiccups.
This package contains a build of LatencyTOP with GUI interface. For a build
without GUI install latencytop-tui instead.

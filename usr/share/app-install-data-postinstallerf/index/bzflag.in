BZFlag is a 3D multi-player tank battle game  that  allows users to play
against each other in a networked environment.  There are five teams red,
green, blue, purple and rogue (rogue tanks are black).  Destroying a player
on another team  scores a win, while being destroyed or destroying a teammate
scores a loss.  Rogues have no teammates (not even other rogues), so they
cannot shoot teammates and they do not have a team score.
There are two main styles of play capture-the-flag and free-for-all.

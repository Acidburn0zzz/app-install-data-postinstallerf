The package lets you change page layout parameters in small
steps over a range of values using options. It can set
\textwidth appropriately for the main fount, and ensure that
the text fits inside the printable area of a printer. An
rmpage-formatted document can be typeset identically without
rmpage after a single cut and paste operation. Local
configuration can set defaults for all documents; and by
class, by printer, and by paper size. The geometry package is
better if you want to set page layout parameters to particular
measurements.

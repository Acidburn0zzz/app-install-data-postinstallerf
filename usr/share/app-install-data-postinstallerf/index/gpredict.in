Gpredict is a real time satellite tracking and orbit prediction
program written using the Gtk+ widgets. Gpredict is targeted mainly
towards ham radio operators but others interested in satellite
tracking may find it useful as well. Gpredict uses the SGP4/SDP4
algorithms, which are compatible with the NORAD Keplerian elements.

Comment3='
The package implements a decorative swelled rule using only a
symbol from a font installed with all distributions of TeX, so
it works independently, without the need to install any
additional software or fonts. This is the packaged version of
the macro which was originally published in the "Typographers
Inn" column in TUGboat 311 (2010).

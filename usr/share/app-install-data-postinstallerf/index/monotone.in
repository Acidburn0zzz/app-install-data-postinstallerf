Comment3='
monotone is a free, distributed version control system.
It provides fully disconnected operation, manages complete
tree versions, keeps its state in a local transactional
database, supports overlapping branches and extensible
metadata, exchanges work over plain network protocols,
performs history-sensitive merging, and delegates trust
functions to client-side RSA certificates.

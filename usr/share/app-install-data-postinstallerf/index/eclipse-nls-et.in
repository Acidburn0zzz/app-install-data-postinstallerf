This language pack for Estonian
contains user-contributed translations of the
strings in all Eclipse projects. Please see the http//babel.eclipse.org/
Babel project web pages for a full how-to-use explanation of these
translations as well as how you can contribute to
the translations of this and future versions of Eclipse.
Note that English text will be displayed if Babel doesnt
have a translation for a given string.

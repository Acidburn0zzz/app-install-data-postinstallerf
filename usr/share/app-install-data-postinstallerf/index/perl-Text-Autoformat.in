TextAutoformat provides intelligent formatting of plaintext without the
need for any kind of embedded mark-up. The module recognizes Internet
quoting conventions, a wide range of bulleting and number schemes, centered
text, and block quotations, and reformats each appropriately. Other options
allow the user to adjust inter-word and inter-paragraph spacing, justify
text, and impose various capitalization schemes.

The module also supplies a re-entrant, highly configurable replacement for
the built-in Perl format() mechanism.

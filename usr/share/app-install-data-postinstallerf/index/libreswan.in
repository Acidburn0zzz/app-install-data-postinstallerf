Libreswan is a free implementation of IPsec & IKE for Linux.  IPsec is
the Internet Protocol Security and uses strong cryptography to provide
both authentication and encryption services.  These services allow you
to build secure tunnels through untrusted networks.  Everything passing
through the untrusted net is encrypted by the ipsec gateway machine and
decrypted by the gateway at the other end of the tunnel.  The resulting
tunnel is a virtual private network or VPN.

This package contains the daemons and userland tools for setting up
Libreswan. To build KLIPS, see the kmod-libreswan.spec file.

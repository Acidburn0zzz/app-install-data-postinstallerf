Perf Tools is a collection of performance analysis tools, including a
high-performance multi-threaded malloc() implementation that works
particularly well with threads and STL, a thread-friendly heap-checker,
a heap profiler, and a cpu-profiler.

This is a metapackage which pulls in all of the gperftools (and pprof)
binaries, libraries, and development headers, so that you can use them.

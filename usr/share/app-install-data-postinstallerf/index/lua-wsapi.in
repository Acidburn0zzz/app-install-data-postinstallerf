WSAPI is an API that abstracts the web server from Lua web applications. By
coding against WSAPI your application can run on any of the supported servers
and interfaces (currently CGI, FastCGI and Xavante, on Windows and UNIX-based
systems).

WSAPI provides a set of helper libraries that help with request processing
and output buffering. You can also write applications that act as filters that
provide some kind of service to other applications, such as authentication,
file uploads, request isolation, or multiplexing.

Cython wrapper to provide python interfaces to the grib library.

GRIB is the the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) standard for
distributing gridded data. This module contains python interfaces for reading
and writing GRIB data using the ECMWF GRIB API C library, and the NCEP GRIB2
C library, as well as command-line utilities for listing and re-packing GRIB
files.

SQLTranslator is a group of Perl modules that converts vendor-specific
SQL table definitions into other formats, such as other vendor-specific
SQL, ER diagrams, documentation (POD and HTML), XML, and ClassDBI
classes.  The main focus of SQLTranslator is SQL, but parsers exist
for other structured data formats, including Excel spreadsheets and
arbitrarily delimited text files.  Through the separation of the code into
parsers and producers with an object model in between, it?s possible to
combine any parser with any producer, to plug in custom parsers or
producers, or to manipulate the parsed data via the built-in object model.
Presently only the definition parts of SQL are handled (CREATE, ALTER),

Comment3='
This package is intended to provide a method whereby the P-values of a set
of GO annotations can be determined for a set of genes, based on the number
of genes that exist in the particular genome (or in a selected background
distribution from the genome), and their annotation, and the frequency with
which the GO nodes are annotated across the provided set of genes. The
P-value is simply calculated using the hypergeometric distribution as the
probability of x or more out of n genes having a given annotation, given
that G of N have that annotation in the genome in general. We chose the
hypergeometric distribution (sampling without replacement) since it is more
accurate, though slower to calculate, than the binomial distribution

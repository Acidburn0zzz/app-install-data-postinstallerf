Numdisplay provides the capability to visualize numpy array objects using
astronomical image display tools such as DS9 or XIMTOOL directly from
the Python command line. This task can display any numpy object, whether
it was created interactively or read in from a FITS file using PyFITS
on any platform which supports Python and numpy.

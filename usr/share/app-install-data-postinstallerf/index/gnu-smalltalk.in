GNU Smalltalk is an implementation that closely follows the
Smalltalk-80 language as described in the book `Smalltalk-80 the
Language and its Implementation by Adele Goldberg and David Robson.
The Smalltalk programming language is an object oriented programming
language.

Unlike other Smalltalks (including Smalltalk-80), GNU Smalltalk
emphasizes Smalltalks rapid prototyping features rather than the
graphical and easy-to-use nature of the programming environment.

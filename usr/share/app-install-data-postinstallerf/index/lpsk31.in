Comment3='
lpsk31 is a ncurses console application for ham radio communications in the
popular PSK31 digital mode. lpsk31 uses only integer arithmetic for both signal
detection and audio tone synthesis, so that it needs no floating point
calculations for its operation. lpsk31 can keep a log of QSOs in text and ADIF
format as well as a raw log of all that is typed in the transmit window or
displayed in the receive window.

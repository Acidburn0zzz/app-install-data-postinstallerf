Comment3='
Hackedbox is a stripped down version of Blackbox - The X11 Window Manager.
The toolbar and Slit have been removed. The goal of Hackedbox is to be a
small "feature-set" window manager, with no bloat. There are no plans to
add any functionality, only bugfixes and speed enhancements whenever possible.

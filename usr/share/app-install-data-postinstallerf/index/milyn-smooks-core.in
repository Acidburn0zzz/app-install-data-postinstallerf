Comment3='
Smooks is a framework for "fragment based" filtering and
serialisation of XML (.. XHTML/HTML etc).  It allows you perform
transformation and analysis on messages using different technologies
(Java, Groovy, XSLT, StringTemplate, etc) both separately and in
collaboration i.e. it allows you mix technologies within the scope
of a single message transformation.
Smooks can also be used simply as an XML analysis tool.

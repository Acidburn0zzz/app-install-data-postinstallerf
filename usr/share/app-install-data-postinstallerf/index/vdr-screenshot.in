Comment3='
With this plugin you can take still images of your screen. After installing
the plugin, a new mainmenu entry "Screenshot" will show up. Each time you
select this item, a file /var/cache/vdr/screenshot/title-yyyymmdd-hhmmss.jpg
will be created, where title is the current transmission or the recording
currently replayed.

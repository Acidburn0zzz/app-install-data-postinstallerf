Doodle is a tool to quickly search the documents on a computer. Doodle builds
an index using meta-data contained in the documents and allows fast searches on
the resulting database. Doodle uses libextractor to support obtaining meta-data
from various file-formats. The database used by doodle is a suffix tree,
resulting in fast lookups. Doodle supports approximate searches.

The w3m program is a pager (or text file viewer) that can also be used
as a text-mode Web browser. W3m features include the following when
reading an HTML document, you can follow links and view images using
an external image viewer; its internet message mode determines the
type of document from the header; if the Content-Type field of the
document is text/html, the document is displayed as an HTML document;
you can change a URL description like http//hogege.net in plain
text into a link to that URL.
If you want to display the inline images on w3m, you need to install
w3m-img package as well.

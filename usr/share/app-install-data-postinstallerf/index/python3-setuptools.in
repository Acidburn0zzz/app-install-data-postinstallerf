Setuptools is a collection of enhancements to the Python 3 distutils that allow
you to more easily build and distribute Python 3 packages, especially ones that
have dependencies on other packages.

This package also contains the runtime components of setuptools, necessary to
execute the software that requires pkg_resources.py.

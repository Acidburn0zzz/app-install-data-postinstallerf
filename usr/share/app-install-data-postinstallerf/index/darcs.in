Darcs is a distributed, interactive, smart revision control system.
Darcs is easy to learn and efficient to use because it asks you questions
in response to simple commands, giving you choices in your workflow.
You can choose to record one change in a file, while ignoring another.
You can review each patch as you update from upstream.
Originally developed by physicist David Roundy,
darcs is based on a unique algebra of patches.

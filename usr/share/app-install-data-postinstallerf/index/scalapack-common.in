The ScaLAPACK (or Scalable LAPACK) library includes a subset
of LAPACK routines redesigned for distributed memory MIMD
parallel computers. It is currently written in a
Single-Program-Multiple-Data style using explicit message
passing for inter-processor communication. It assumes
matrices are laid out in a two-dimensional block cyclic
decomposition.

ScaLAPACK is designed for heterogeneous computing and is
portable on any computer that supports MPI or PVM.

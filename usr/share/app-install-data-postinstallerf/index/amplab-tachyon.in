Comment3='
Tachyon is a fault tolerant distributed file system
enabling reliable file sharing at memory-speed
across cluster frameworks, such as Spark and MapReduce.
It achieves high performance by leveraging lineage
information and using memory aggressively.
Tachyon caches working set files in memory, and
enables different jobs/queries and frameworks to
access cached files at memory speed. Thus, Tachyon
avoids going to disk to load data-sets that
are frequently read.

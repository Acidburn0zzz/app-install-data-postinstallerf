OpticalRayTracer is a X Window GUI-based utility that analyzes systems of
lenses. It uses optical principles and a virtual optical bench to predict
the behavior of many kinds of ordinary and exotic lens types.

OpticalRayTracer includes an advanced, easy-to-use interface that allows the
user to rearrange the optical configuration by simply dragging lenses around
using the mouse.

Comment3='
Unifont is a fixed-width Unicode font with a glyph for every visible
Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane code point and more. The latest
version of Unifont includes approximately 54,700 glyphs for all the
visible Unicode BMP code points.

This font strives for very wide coverage rather than beauty, so use it
only as fallback or for special purposes.

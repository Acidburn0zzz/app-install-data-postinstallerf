Web Secretary is a web page change monitoring software. It will detect changes
based on content analysis, making sure that its not just HTML that changed,
but actual content. You can tell it what to ignore in the page (hit counters
and such), and it can mail you the document with the changes highlighted or
load the highlighted page in a browser.

Comment3='
The Examiner is an application that utilizes the objdump command to
disassemble and comment foreign executable binaries. This app was
designed to analyze static compiled binaries but works ok with
others. The intention is for forensic research but could also be used
in general reverse engineering.
           This program can only handle basic dissassembly. If the
binary has been modified to resist debugging then the Examinier
probably will not be able to analyze the code. Also the Examiner will
not analyze live running code.

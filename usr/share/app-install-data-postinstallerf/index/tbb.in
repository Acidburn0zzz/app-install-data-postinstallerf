Comment3='
Threading Building Blocks (TBB) is a C++ runtime library that
abstracts the low-level threading details necessary for optimal
multi-core performance.  It uses common C++ templates and coding style
to eliminate tedious threading implementation work.

TBB requires fewer lines of code to achieve parallelism than other
threading models.  The applications you write are portable across
platforms.  Since the library is also inherently scalable, no code
maintenance is required as more processor cores become available.

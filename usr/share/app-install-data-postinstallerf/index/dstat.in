Dstat is a versatile replacement for vmstat, iostat, netstat and ifstat.
Dstat overcomes some of their limitations and adds some extra features,
more counters and flexibility. Dstat is handy for monitoring systems
during performance tuning tests, benchmarks or troubleshooting.

Dstat allows you to view all of your system resources instantly, you
can eg. compare disk usage in combination with interrupts from your
IDE controller, or compare the network bandwidth numbers directly
with the disk throughput (in the same interval).

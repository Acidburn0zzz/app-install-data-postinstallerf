Applying coding standards to large amounts of legacy code is a daunting
task. Often times, legacy code is so non-compliant that it seems downright
impossible. But, if you consistently chip away at the problem, you will
eventually succeed! TestPerlCriticProgressive uses the PerlCritic
engine to prevent further deterioration of your code and gradually steer it
towards conforming with your chosen coding standards.

lessphp is a compiler that generates CSS from a superset language which
adds a collection of convenient features often seen in other languages.
All CSS is compatible with LESS, so you can start using new features
with your existing CSS.

It is designed to be compatible with less.js (http//lesscss.org/), and
suitable as a drop in replacement for PHP projects.

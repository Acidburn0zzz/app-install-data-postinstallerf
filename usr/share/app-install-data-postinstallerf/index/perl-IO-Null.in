Comment3='
IONull is a class for null filehandles.  Calling a constructor of
this class always succeeds, returning a new null filehandle.  Writing
to any object of this class is always a no-operation, and returns
true.  Reading from any object of this class is always no-operation,
and returns empty-string or empty-list, as appropriate.

This module aims to provide a nicer syntax and method to catch errors in
Perl, similar to what is found in other languages (such as Java, Python or
C++). The standard method of using eval {}; if ($@) {} is often prone to
subtle bugs, primarily that its far too easy to stomp on the error in error
handlers. And also eval/if isnt the nicest idiom.

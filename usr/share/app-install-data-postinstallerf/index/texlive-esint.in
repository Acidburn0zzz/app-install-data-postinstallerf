The esint package permits access to alternate integral symbols
when youre using the Computer Modern fonts. In the original
set, several integral symbols are missing, such as \oiint. Many
of these symbols are available in other font sets (pxfonts,
txfonts, etc.), but there is no good solution if you want to
use Computer Modern. The package provides Metafont source and
LaTeX macro support.

VIM (VIsual editor iMproved) is an updated and improved version of the
vi editor.  Vi was the first real screen-based editor for UNIX, and is
still very popular.  VIM improves on vi by adding new features
multiple windows, multi-level undo, block highlighting and more. The
vim-minimal package includes a minimal version of VIM, which is
installed into /bin/vi for use when only the root partition is
present. NOTE The online help is only available when the vim-common
package is installed.

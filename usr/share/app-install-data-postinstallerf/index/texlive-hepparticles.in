HEPparticles is a set of macros for typesetting high energy
particle names, to meet the following criteria 1. The main
particle name is a Roman or Greek symbol, to be typeset in
upright font in normal contexts. 2. Additionally a superscript
and/or subscript may follow the main symbol. 3. Particle
resonances may also have a resonance specifier which is typeset

The particle names are expected to be used both in and out of
mathematical contexts. 5. If the surrounding text is bold or

Comment3='
wxSQLite3 is a C++ wrapper around the public domain SQLite 3.x database and is
specifically designed for use in programs based on the wxWidgets library.
wxSQLite3 does not try to hide the underlying database, in contrary almost all
special features of the current SQLite3 version 3.6.22 are supported, like for
example the creation of user defined scalar or aggregate functions. Since
SQLite stores strings in UTF-8 encoding, the wxSQLite3 methods provide
automatic conversion between wxStrings and UTF-8 strings. This works best for
the Unicode builds of wxWidgets. In ANSI builds the current locale conversion
object (wxConvCurrent) is used for conversion to/from UTF-8. Special care has
to be taken if external administration tools are used to modify the database

Comment3='
iodine lets you tunnel IPv4 data through a DNS server. This can be usable in
different situations where internet access is firewalled, but DNS queries are
allowed.

It runs on Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Windows and needs a
TUN/TAP device. The bandwidth is asymmetrical with limited upstream and up to
1 Mbit/s downstream.
This is meta-package to install both client and server.
It also contain three documantation files CHANGELOG, README, TODO.

Comment3='
Stackable dynamic tree based Rack router. Supports Rack?s X-Cascade convention
to continue trying routes if the response returns pass. This allows multiple
routes to be nested or stacked on top of each other. Since the application
endpoint can trigger the router to continue matching, middle-ware can be used
to add arbitrary conditions to any route. This allows you to route based
on other request attributes, session information, or even data dynamically
pulled from a database.

Comment3='
When this plugin is installed it will automatically copy all downloaded packages
to a repository on the local filesystem, and (re)build that repository. This
means that anything youve downloaded will always exist, even if the original
repo. removes it (and can thus. be reinstalled/downgraded/etc.).

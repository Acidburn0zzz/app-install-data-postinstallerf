OCaml is a high-level, strongly-typed, functional and object-oriented
programming language from the ML family of languages.

This package contains some modules used internally by the OCaml
compilers, useful for the development of some OCaml applications.
Note that this exposes internal details of the OCaml compiler which
may not be portable between versions.

Comment='<span size="xx-large">Concrete functor and monad transformers</span>'
Comment3='
A portable library of functor and monad transformers, inspired by the paper
"Functional Programming with Overloading and Higher-Order Polymorphism", by
Mark P Jones, in "Advanced School of Functional Programming", 1995
(<http//web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/springschool.html>).

This package contains
* the monad transformer class (in "Control.Monad.Trans.Class")
* concrete functor and monad transformers, each with associated operations and
functions to lift operations associated with other transformers.

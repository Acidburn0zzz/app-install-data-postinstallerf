Comment3='
Package to fit text to a given width or height by scaling the
font. For example \scaletowidth{3in}{This}. (The job is done
by calculating a magstep and applying it to the current font;
thus "This" will be very tall, as well as very wide; to scale
in just one dimension, use the facilities of the graphicx
package.)

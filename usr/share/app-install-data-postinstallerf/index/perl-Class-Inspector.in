ClassInspector allows you to get information about a loaded class.
Most or all of this information can be found in other ways, but they arent
always very friendly, and usually involve a relatively high level of Perl
wizardry, or strange and unusual looking code. ClassInspector attempts to
provide an easier, more friendly interface to this information.

Naga aims to be a very small NIO library that provides a handful of
java classes to wrap the usual Socket and ServerSocket with
asynchronous NIO counterparts (similar to NIO2 planned for Java 1.7).

All of this is driven from a single thread, making it useful for both
client (e.g. allowing I/O to be done in the AWT-thread without any
need for threads) and server programming (1 thread for all connections

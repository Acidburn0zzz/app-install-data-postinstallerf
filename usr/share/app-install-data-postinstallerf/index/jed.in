Jed is a fast, compact editor based on the S-lang screen library.  Jed
features include emulation of the Emacs, EDT, WordStar and Brief
editors; support for extensive customization with slang macros,
colors, keybindings; and a variety of programming modes with syntax
highlighting.

You should install jed if youve used it before and you like it, or if
you havent used any text editors before and youre still deciding
what youd like to use.

Nall is a small gtk+ application that discretely fits into your freedesktop
system tray (such as trayer).

Its purpose is to spawn periodically every kind of script and display a
one-line output in the tooltip window. The main usage of nall is monitoring or
just notifying of almost everything (it just depends upon your imagination and
ability to script).

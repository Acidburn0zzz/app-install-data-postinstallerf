Comment3='
OMake is a build system designed for scalability and portability. It
uses a syntax similar to make utilities you may have used, but it
features many additional enhancements, including the following.

 * Support for projects spanning several directories or directory
   hierarchies.
 * Fast, reliable, automated, scriptable dependency analysis using MD5
   digests, with full support for incremental builds.

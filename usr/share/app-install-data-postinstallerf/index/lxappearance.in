LXAppearance is a new GTK+ theme switcher developed for LXDE, the Lightweight
X11 Desktop Environment. It is able to change GTK+ themes, icon themes, and
fonts used by applications. All changes done by the users can be seen
immediately in the preview area. After clicking the "Apply" button, the
settings will be written to gtkrc, and all running programs will be asked to
reload their themes.

Backup Manager is a command line backup tool for GNU/Linux, designed to help
you make daily archives of your file system. Written in bash and Perl, it can
make archives in lots of open formats (tar, gzip, bzip2, lzma, dar, zip) and
provides lots of interesting features (such as network exports or CD/DVD
automated-burning).

The program is designed to be as easy to use as possible and is popular with
desktop users and sysadmins. The whole backup process is defined in one
full-documented configuration file which needs no more than 5 minutes to tune
for your needs.

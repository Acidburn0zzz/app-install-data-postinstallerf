libGringotts is a small, easy-to-use, thread-safe C library
 originally developed for Gringotts; its purpose is to
encapsulate data (generic ASCII, but also binary data)
in an encrypted and compressed structure, to be written
in a file or used elseway. It makes use of strong
encryption algorithms, to ensure the data are as safe
as possible, and allow the user to have the complete
control over all the algorithms used in the process.

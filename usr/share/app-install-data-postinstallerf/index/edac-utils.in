Comment3='
EDAC is the current set of drivers in the Linux kernel that handle
detection of ECC errors from memory controllers for most chipsets
on i386 and x86_64 architectures. This userspace component consists
of an init script which makes sure EDAC drivers and DIMM labels
are loaded at system startup, as well as a library and utility
for reporting current error counts from the EDAC sysfs files.

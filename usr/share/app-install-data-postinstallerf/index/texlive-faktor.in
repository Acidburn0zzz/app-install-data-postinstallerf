The package provides the means to typeset factor structures, as
are used in many areas of algebraic notation. The structure is
similar to the A/B that is provided by the nicefrac package
(part of the units distribution), and by the xfrac package; the
most obvious difference is that the numerator and denominators
sizes do not change in the \faktor command.

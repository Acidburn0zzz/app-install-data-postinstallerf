Comment3='
The scope of this package is to define an API in line with the current
Java Platform APIs to support an alternative invocation mechanism
which could be used instead of the public static void main(String[])
method.  This specification covers the behavior and life cycle of what
we define as Java daemons, or, in other words, non interactive
Java applications.

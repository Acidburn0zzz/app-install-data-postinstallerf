Printrun is a set of G-code sending applications for RepRap.
It consists of printcore (dumb G-code sender), pronsole (featured command line
G-code sender), pronterface (featured G-code sender with graphical user
interface), and a small collection of helpful scripts. Together with skeinforge
they form a pretty powerful softwarecombo. This package installs whole Printrun.

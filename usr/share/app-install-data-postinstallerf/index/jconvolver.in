Jconvolver is a real-time convolution engine. It can execute up to a 64 by 64
convolution matrix (i.e. 4096 simultaneous convolutions) as long as your CPU(s)
can handle the load. It is designed to be efficient also for sparse (e.g.
diagonal) matrices. Unused matrix elements do not take any CPY time.

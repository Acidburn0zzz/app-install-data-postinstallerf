An arcade style like game. The goal is to fight out all gold from the caves and
go into in the door. Sounds simple, but try it. The challenge Because some bad
blue Monks want prevent you from that, they bite of your head if the catch you,
good luck. Further the caves(levels) are often like mazes with dangers and
traps, to pass them you need a lot of skill.

Note that this game is hardcoded at a resolution of 1024x768, so if your
display cannot handle this you are out of luck.

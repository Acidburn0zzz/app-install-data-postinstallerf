Shake is a Haskell library for writing build systems - designed as a
replacement for make. See "Development.Shake" for an introduction, including
an example. Further examples are included in the Cabal tarball, under the
Examples directory. The homepage contains links to a user manual, an academic
paper and further information <https//github.com/ndmitchell/shake>

This package provides the shake tool which can handle most ninja files
faster than ninja and simple makefiles.

The Computer Music Toolkit (CMT) is a collection of LADSPA plugins for
use with software synthesis and recording packages on Linux. See the
license before use.

The CMT is developed primarily by Richard W.E. Furse the principle
designer of the LADSPA standard, with additional plugins by Jezar and
David Bartold. If you are a programmer or can write documentation and
would like to help out, please feel free to contact Richard.

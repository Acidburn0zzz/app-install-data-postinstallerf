H264 streaming module enable viewers to immediately jump to any part of
the video regardless of the length of the video or whether it has all
been downloaded yet. It also supports virtual video clips, so it can
be specified to only playback a part of the video or create download
links to specific parts of the video. If the video is already using the
widely adopted MPEG4/H264 industry standard, theres no need to recode
MP4 videos, the existing video files can be used.

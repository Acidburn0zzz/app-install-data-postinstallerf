PMD scans Java source code and looks for potential problems like
* Possible bugs empty try/catch/finally/switch statements
+ Dead code unused local variables, parameters and private methods
+ Suboptimal code wasteful String/StringBuffer usage
+ Overcomplicated expressions unnecessary if statements, for loops
  that could be while loops
+ Duplicate code copied/pasted code means copied/pasted bugs

PMD has plugins for JDeveloper, Eclipse, JEdit, JBuilder, BlueJ,
CodeGuide, NetBeans/Sun Java Studio Enterprise/Creator, IntelliJ IDEA,

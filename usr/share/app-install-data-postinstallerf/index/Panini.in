Panini can load most common photo and panoramic formats from image files such
as those created with hugin or QuickTimeVR (QTVR .mov) files.  Like all pano
viewers, it then shows a linear perspective view that can be panned and zoomed.
But Panini can also display a range of wide angle perspectives via the
stereographic and "Pannini" vedutismo families of projections, and shift,
rotate, and stretch the image like a software view camera.

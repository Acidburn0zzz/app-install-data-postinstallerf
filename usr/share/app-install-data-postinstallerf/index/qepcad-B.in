QEPCAD is an implementation of quantifier elimination by partial
cylindrical algebraic decomposition due originally to Hoon Hong, and
subsequently added on to by many others.  It is an interactive
command-line program written in C/C++, and based on the SACLIB library.
This is QEPCAD B version 1.x, the "B" designating a substantial
departure from the original QEPCAD and distinguishing it from any
development of the original that may proceed in a different direction.

A toolkit for reliable multicast communication.
It allows developers to create reliable multipoint (multicast) applications
where reliability is a deployment issue, and does not have to be implemented
by the application developer. This saves application developers significant
amounts of time, and allows for the application to be deployed in different
environments, without having to change code.

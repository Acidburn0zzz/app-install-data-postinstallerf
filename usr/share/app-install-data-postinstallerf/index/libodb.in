ODB is an object-relational mapping (ORM) system for C++. It provides
tools, APIs, and library support that allow you to persist C++ objects
to a relational database (RDBMS) without having to deal with tables,
columns, or SQL and without manually writing any of the mapping code.

This package contains the common ODB runtime library. Every application
that includes code generated by the ODB compiler will need to link to
this library.

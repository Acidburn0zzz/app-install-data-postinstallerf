Kexi is an integrated data management application.  It can be used for
creating database schemas, inserting data, performing queries, and
processing data. Forms can be created to provide a custom interface to
your data. All database objects ? tables, queries and forms ? are
stored in the database, making it easy to share data and design.

For additional database drivers take a look at calligra-kexi-driver-*

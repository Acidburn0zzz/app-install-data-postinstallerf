Fast logging infrastructure for Go

FactorLog is a fast logging infrastructure for Go that provides numerous
logging functions for whatever your style may be. It could easily be a
replacement for Gos log in the standard library (though it doesnt support
functions such as SetFlags()).
This package contains library source intended for building other packages
which use kdar/factorlog.

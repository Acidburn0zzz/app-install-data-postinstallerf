Comment3='
Plotting functions with pst-plot is very powerful but sometimes
difficult to learn since the syntax of \psplot and
\parametricplot requires some PostScript knowledge. The infix-
RPN and pst-infixplot styles simplify the usage of pst-plot for
the beginner, providing macro commands that convert natural
mathematical expressions to PostScript syntax.

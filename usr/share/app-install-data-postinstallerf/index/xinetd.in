Xinetd is a secure replacement for inetd, the Internet services
daemon. Xinetd provides access control for all services based on the
address of the remote host and/or on time of access and can prevent
denial-of-access attacks. Xinetd provides extensive logging, has no
limit on the number of server arguments, and lets you bind specific
services to specific IP addresses on your host machine. Each service
has its own specific configuration file for Xinetd; the files are
located in the /etc/xinetd.d directory.

Tipcutils is a set of userspace programs used to configure and manage TIPC on
your system. It provides the tipc-config and tipc-pipe utilities.
The tipc-config tool provides numerous commands for configuring and
monitoring a TIPC network. Certain commands are only available to users
having network administrator privileges (eg. root) to prevent unauthorized
users from reconfiguring the network. The tipc-pipe utility acts as a netcat
like program for TIPC. It is used for reading and writing network connections
using TIPC.

AA-lib is a low level gfx library just as many other libraries are. The
main difference is that AA-lib does not require graphics device. In
fact, there is no graphical output possible. AA-lib replaces those
old-fashioned output methods with a powerful ASCII art renderer. The API
is designed to be similar to other graphics libraries.

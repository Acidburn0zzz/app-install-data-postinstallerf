gipfel is a tool to find the names of mountains or points of interest
on a picture. It uses a database containing names and GPS data. With
the given viewpoint (the point from which the picture was taken) and
two known mountains on the picture, it can compute all parameters
needed to compute the positions of other mountains on the picture.
gipfel can also generate (stitch) panorama images.

Comment3='
JPL is a library using the SWI-Prolog foreign interface and the Java Native
Interface providing a bidirectional interface between Java and Prolog
that can be used to embed Prolog in Java as well as for embedding Java
in Prolog. In both setups it provides a re-entrant bidirectional interface.

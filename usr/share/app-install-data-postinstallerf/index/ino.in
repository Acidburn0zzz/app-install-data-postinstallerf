Ino is a command line toolkit for working with Arduino hardware.

It allows you to
Quickly create new projects
Build a firmware from multiple source files and libraries
Upload the firmware to a device
Perform serial communication with a device (aka serial monitor)
Ino may replace Arduino IDE UI if you prefer to work with command line and
an editor of your choice or if you want to integrate Arduino build process

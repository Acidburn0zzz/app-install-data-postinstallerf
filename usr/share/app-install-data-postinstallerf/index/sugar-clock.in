This activity displays time in analog, digital, and "natural" forms.
The "natural" form will be an image of a sun or moon arcing across
the sky, rising and setting as the day progresses. This is more than
a simple clock; the user will be able to grab any element and readjust
it, which will update each of the other elements. In this manner,
hopefully the children can explore and understand different methods of
telling time.

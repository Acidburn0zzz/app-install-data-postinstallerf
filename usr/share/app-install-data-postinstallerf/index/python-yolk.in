Yolk is a Python tool for obtaining information about packages installed by
distutils, setuptools and easy_install and querying packages on PyPI
(Python Package Index a.k.a. The Cheese Shop).

Yolk can list all the packages installed by distutils or setuptools on your
system by Python2.5 or packages installed by setuptools if you have Python2.4.
You can see which packages are active, non-active or in development mode and
show you which have newer versions available by querying PyPI.

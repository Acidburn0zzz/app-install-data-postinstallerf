Comment3='
GlueGen is a tool which automatically generates the Java and JNI
code necessary to call C libraries. It reads as input ANSI C header
files and separate configuration files which provide control over
many aspects of the glue code generation. GlueGen uses a complete
ANSI C parser and an internal representation (IR) capable of
representing all C types to represent the APIs for which it
generates interfaces.

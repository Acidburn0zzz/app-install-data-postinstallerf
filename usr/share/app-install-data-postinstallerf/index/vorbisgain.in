VorbisGain is a utility that uses a psychoacoustic method to correct the
volume of an Ogg Vorbis file to a predefined standardized loudness.

It needs player support to work. Non-supporting players will play back
the files without problems, but youll miss out on the benefits.
Nowadays most good players such as ogg123, xmms and mplayer are already
compatible.

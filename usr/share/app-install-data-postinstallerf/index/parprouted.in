Comment3='
parprouted is a daemon for transparent IP (Layer 3) proxy ARP bridging.
Unlike standard bridging, proxy ARP bridging allows to bridge Ethernet
networks behind wireless nodes. Normal L2 bridging does not work between
wireless nodes because wireless does not know about MAC addresses used
in the wired Ethernet networks. Also this daemon is useful for making
transparent firewalls.

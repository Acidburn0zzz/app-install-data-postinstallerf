Graphical front-end for systemd. It provides a simple user interface to manage
services, and a graphical agent to request passwords from the user.

The systemadm program has received little development or maintenance in the
last few years, because development focus has shifted to command-line tools
like systemctl and systemd-analyze. Nevertheless, despite awkward graphical
design, systemadm remains the only graphical application for systemd unit
management. YMMV.

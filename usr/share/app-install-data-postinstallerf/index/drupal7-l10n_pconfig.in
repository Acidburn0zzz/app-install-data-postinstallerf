The plural formula configurator sets sensible defaults for plural forms when
adding languages and lets you edit the plural formula for all languages on the
web interface.

Drupal does not expose these fields for editing due to the complexity of plural
forms. You should make sure to only give permissions to edit language details
to those, who will likely not screw up your plural formulas.

Comment3='
"EmailAbstract" provides module writers with the ability to write
representation-independent mail handling code. For instance, in the
cases of "MailThread" or "MailListDetector", a key part of the code
involves reading the headers from a mail object. Where previously one
would either have to specify the mail class required, or to build a new
object from scratch, "EmailAbstract" can be used to perform certain
simple operations on an object regardless of its underlying
representation.

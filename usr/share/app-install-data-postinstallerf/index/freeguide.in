FreeGuide is a TV guide program. It uses parser programs to extract TV
information from web pages and stores them for viewing without the need to
connect to the Internet. The viewer allows the user to view television listings
and create customized TV guides by selecting programs and by building up a
favorites list.

It works with listings for many countries.  Check the web site
freeguide-tv.sf.net for details.

Lemon is an open source POS (point of sale) for Linux, and other Unix.
It is a general POS, not targeted to a specific business.

It has been developed for ease of use and customization, and to support
bar-code scanners and ticket printers. At this point, it has been tested
with a parallel port ticket printer (Star Micronics, SP500).

Comment3='
doctest (and recently manuel) provide hooks for using custom doctest
parsers.  `zc.customdoctests` helps to leverage this to support other
languages, such as JavaScript

js> function double (x) { ...     return x*2; ... } js> double(2) 4
And with manuel, it facilitates doctests that mix multiple languages,
such as Python, JavaScript, and sh.

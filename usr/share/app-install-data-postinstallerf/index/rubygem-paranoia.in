Comment3='
Paranoia is a re-implementation of acts_as_paranoid
(http//github.com/technoweenie/acts_as_paranoid) for Rails 3, using much,
much, much less code. You would use either plugin / gem if you wished that
when you called destroy on an Active Record object that it didnt actually
destroy it, but just "hid" the record. Paranoia does this by setting a
deleted_at field to the current time when you destroy a record, and hides
it by scoping all queries on your model to only include records which do not
have a deleted_at field.

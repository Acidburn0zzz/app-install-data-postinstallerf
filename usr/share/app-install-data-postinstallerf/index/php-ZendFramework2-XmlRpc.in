Comment3='
From its home page, XML-RPC is described as a ?...remote procedure calling
using HTTP as the transport and XML as the encoding. XML-RPC is designed to
be as simple as possible, while allowing complex data structures to be
transmitted, processed and returned.?

Zend Framework provides support for both consuming remote XML-RPC services
and building new XML-RPC servers.

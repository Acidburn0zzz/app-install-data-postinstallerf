GFS Complutum derives, via a long development, from a
minuscule-only font cut in the 16th century. An unsatisfactory
set of majuscules were added in the early 20th century, but its
author died before he could complete the revival of the font.
The Greek Font Society has released this version, which has a
new set of majuscules.

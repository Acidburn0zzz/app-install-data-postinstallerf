radvd is the router advertisement daemon for IPv6.  It listens to router
solicitations and sends router advertisements as described in "Neighbor
hosts can automatically configure their addresses and some other
parameters.  They also can choose a default router based on these
advertisements.

Install radvd if you are setting up IPv6 network and/or Mobile IPv6
services.

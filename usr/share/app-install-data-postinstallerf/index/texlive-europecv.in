Comment3='
The europecv class is an unofficial LaTeX implementation of the
standard model for curricula vitae (the "Europass CV") as
recommended by the European Commission. Although primarily
intended for users in the European Union, the class is flexible
enough to be used for any kind of curriculum vitae. The class
has localisations for all the official languages of the EU
(plus Catalan), as well as options permitting input in UTF-8
and koi8-r.

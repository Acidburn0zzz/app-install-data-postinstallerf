The ROOT system provides a set of object oriented frameworks with all
the functionality needed to handle and analyze large amounts of data
in a very efficient way. Having the data defined as a set of objects,
specialized storage methods are used to get direct access to the
separate attributes of the selected objects, without having to touch
the bulk of the data. Included are histogramming methods in 1, 2 and 3
dimensions, curve fitting, function evaluation, minimization, graphics
and visualization classes to allow the easy setup of an analysis
system that can query and process the data interactively or in batch
mode.

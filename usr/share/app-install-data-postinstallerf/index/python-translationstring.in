Comment='<span size="xx-large">Utility library for i18n relied on by various Repoze packages</span>'
Comment3='
A library used by various `Repoze <http//repoze.org>`_ packages for
internationalization (i18n) duties related to translation.

This package provides a *translation string* class, a *translation string
factory* class, translation and pluralization primitives, and a utility that
helps `Chameleon <http//chameleon.repoze.org>`_ templates use translation
facilities of this package.  It does not depend on `Babel
<http//babel.edgewall.org>`_, but its translation and pluralization services
are meant to work best when provided with an instance of the
``babel.support.Translations`` class.

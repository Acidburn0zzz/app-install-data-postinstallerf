Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks.
The algorithms can either be applied directly to a dataset or called from
your own Java code. Weka contains tools for data pre-processing,
classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization.
It is also well-suited for developing new machine learning schemes.

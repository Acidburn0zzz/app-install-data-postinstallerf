Netatalk is a freely-available Open Source AFP fileserver. It also provides a
kernel level implementation of the AppleTalk Protocol Suite. A *NIX/*BSD system
running Netatalk is capable of serving many Macintosh clients simultaneously
as an AppleShare file server (AFP), AppleTalk router, *NIX/*BSD print server,
and for accessing AppleTalk printers via Printer Access Protocol (PAP). Included
are a number of minor printing and debugging utilities.

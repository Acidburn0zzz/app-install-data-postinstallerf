Contains init and configs to launch mldonkey as a service.

NOTE by default incoming dir is located in /var/lib/mldonkey/incoming
and temp dir in /var/lib/cache/mldonkey. Mlondkey is launched
with the mldonkey user (created after installation).
NOTE If you are using a password for your mldonkey, you need to specify
it in your /etc/sysconfig/mldonkey, because mldonkey now stores
it encrypted.

Comment3='
parboiled is a mixed Java/Scala library providing for lightweight and
easy-to-use, yet powerful and elegant parsing of arbitrary input text
based on Parsing expression grammars (PEGs). PEGs are an alternative to
context free grammars (CFGs) for formally specifying syntax, they
make a good replacement for regular expressions and generally have quite
a few advantages over the "traditional" way of building parsers via CFGs.

The board of the game is a complicated maze. You see reddish squares, which are
walls, and black lanes, which are walkable. Also you see brightly coloured
(humanoid) figures and little circles. The figures are the players, and the
rounds are coins which the players must collect.

Each player gets a turn. In the beginning of your turn, you get to change the
maze. You can see a small piece of maze "sticking out" of the board. You can
make that piece move around the board an rotate it. When you are done the
piece is pushed in the maze, thus making a whole column or row of the maze
shift. If you do this in a clever way, new passages open up, hopefully leading

The package pst-pdf simplifies the use of graphics from
PSTricks and other PostScript code in PDF documents. As in
building a bibliography with BibTEX, additional external
programmes are invoked. In this case they are used to create a
PDF file (\PDFcontainer) that will contain all the graphics
material. In the final document these contents will be inserted
instead of the original PostScript code. The package works with
pstricks and requires a recent version of the preview package.

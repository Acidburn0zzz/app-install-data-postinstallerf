Thttpd is a very compact no-frills httpd serving daemon that can handle
very high loads.  While lacking many of the advanced features of
Apache, thttpd operates without forking and is extremely efficient in
memory use.  Basic support for cgi scripts, authentication, and ssi is
provided for.  Advanced features include the ability to throttle traffic.

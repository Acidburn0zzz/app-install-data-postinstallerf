Comment3='
Duplicity incrementally backs up files and directory by encrypting
tar-format volumes with GnuPG and uploading them to a remote (or
local) file server. In theory many protocols for connecting to a
file server could be supported; so far ssh/scp, local file access,
rsync, ftp, HSI, WebDAV and Amazon S3 have been written.

Because duplicity uses librsync, the incremental archives are space
efficient and only record the parts of files that have changed since
the last backup. Currently duplicity supports deleted files, full
unix permissions, directories, symbolic links, fifos, device files,

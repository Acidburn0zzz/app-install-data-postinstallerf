The amanda-server package should be installed on the AMANDA server,
the machine attached to the device(s) (such as a tape drive) where backups
will be written. You will also need to install the amanda package on
the AMANDA server machine.  And, if the server is also to be backed up, the
server also needs to have the amanda-client package installed.

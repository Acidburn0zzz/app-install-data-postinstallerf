Comment3='
Opencryptoki implements the PKCS#11 specification v2.11 for a set of
cryptographic hardware, such as IBM 4764 and 4765 crypto cards, and the
Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip. Opencryptoki also brings a software
token implementation that can be used without any cryptographic
hardware.
This package contains the PKCS#11 library implementation, and requires
at least one token implementation (packaged separately) to be fully
functional.

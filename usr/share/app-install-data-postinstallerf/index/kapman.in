Kapman is a collecting game. You must go through the levels escaping
ghosts in a maze. You lose a life when a ghost eats you, but you can eat
the ghosts for a few seconds when eating an energizer. You win points
when eating pills, energizers, and bonus, and you win one life for
each 10,000 points. When you have eaten all the pills and energizers
of a level, you go to the next level, and the player and ghost speeds
increase. The game ends when you have lost all your lives.

The zope.event package provides a simple event system. It provides
an event publishing system and a very simple event-dispatching system
on which more sophisticated event dispatching systems can be built.
(For example, a type-based event dispatching system that builds on
zope.event can be found in zope.component.)

This package contains the version for Python 3.

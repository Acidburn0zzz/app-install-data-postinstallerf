Bakery is a C++ Framework for creating GNOME applications using gtkmm.
Bakery provides a Document/View architecture, but it doesnt force you
to use the whole architecture. Bakery can use XML as a Document
storage format, if you like. Bakery provides default functionality,
which can be easily customized, makes it easy to start
developing GNOME applications and gives your application
structure. Bakery also contains a few utility classes.

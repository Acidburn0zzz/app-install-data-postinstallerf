gobi_loader is a firmware loader for Qualcomm Gobi USB chipsets. These
devices appear in an uninitialized state when power is applied and require
firmware to be loaded before they can be used as modems. gobi_loader adds
a udev rule that will trigger loading of the firmware and make the modem
usable.

Note that gobi_loader requires firmware images which cant be freely
redistributed. See http//www.codon.org.uk/~mjg59/gobi_loader for more
information.

pngquant converts 24/32-bit RGBA PNG images to 8-bit palette with alpha channel
preserved.  Such images are compatible with all modern web browsers and a
compatibility setting is available to help transparency degrade well in
Internet Explorer 6.  Quantized files are often 40-70 percent smaller than
their 24/32-bit version. pngquant uses the median cut algorithm.

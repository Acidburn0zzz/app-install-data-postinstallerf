Comment3='
This is CryptCBC, a Perl-only implementation of the cryptographic
cipher block chaining mode (CBC).  In combination with a block cipher
such as CryptDES or CryptIDEA, you can encrypt and decrypt
messages of arbitrarily long length.  The encrypted messages are
compatible with the encryption format used by SSLeay.

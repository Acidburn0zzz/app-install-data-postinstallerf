This filter makes it easy to resize images, especially when combined with a
WYSIWYG editor such as tinyMCE or CKeditor. Users never have to worry about
scaling image sizes again, just insert an image and set its height and width
properties in HTML (this is done automatically by WYSIWYG editors) and the
image is resized on output to match the HTML.

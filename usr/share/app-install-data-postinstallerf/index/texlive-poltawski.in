Comment3='
The package contains the Antykwa Poltawskiego family of fonts
in the PostScript Type 1 and OpenType formats. The original
font was designed in the twenties of the XX century by the
Polish typographer Adam Poltawski(1881-1952). Following the
route set out by the Latin Modern and TeX Gyre projects
(http//www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry), the Antykwa
Poltawskiego digitisation project aims at providing a rich
collection of diacritical characters in the attempt to cover as
many Latin-based scripts as possible. To our knowledge, the
repertoire of characters covers all European languages as well

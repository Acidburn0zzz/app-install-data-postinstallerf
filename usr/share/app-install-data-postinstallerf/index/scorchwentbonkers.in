As the name suggests, Scorch Went Bonkers is a remake of the old PC classic.
However, many things were changed and the type of fun delivered by the game is
different. Where Scorched Earth puts emphasis on tactics and careful
calculations, SWB requires quick thinking, perfect timing and only one finger
for controlling your tank. The game is real-time instead of turn based.

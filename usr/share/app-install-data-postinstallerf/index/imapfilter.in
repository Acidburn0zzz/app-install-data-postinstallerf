IMAPFilter is a mail filtering utility. It connects to remote mail servers
using the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), sends searching queries
to the server and processes mailboxes based on the results. It can be used
to delete, copy, move, flag, etc. messages residing in mailboxes at the
same or different mail servers. The 4rev1 and 4 versions of the IMAP
protocol are supported.

Pyrex is Python with C types.  It is specially designed to allow you to
write extension modules for Python that have the speed of C and the
simplicity and readability of Python.  You write your code in a Python-like
language with C-typed variables, then use the pyrexc compiler to transform
it into a C representation.  This is useful for speeding up critical sections
of your Python code or wrapping an external library.

Please see the documentation for how to get the best performance from your
code.

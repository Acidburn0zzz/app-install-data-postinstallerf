DAR is a command line tool to backup a directory tree and files. DAR is
able to make differential backups, split them over a set of disks or files
of a given size, use compression, filter files or subtrees to be saved or
not saved, directly access and restore given files. DAR is also able
to handle extented attributes, and can make remote backups through an
ssh session for example. Finally, DAR handles save and restore of hard
and symbolic links.

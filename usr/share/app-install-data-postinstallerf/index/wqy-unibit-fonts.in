Comment3='
The Wen Quan Yi Unibit is designed as a dual-width (16x16,16x8)
bitmap font to provide the most complete international symbol
coverage, serving as the system-wide fall-back font. This font
has covered over 46000 Unicode code points in BMP.
It is intended to supersede the outdated GNU Unifont.
This font was created by merging the latest update of GNU
Unifont [GPL] (by Roman Czyborra and David Starner et al., the
font was last updated in 2004), WenQuanYi Bitmap Song [GPL]
0.8.1 (by Qianqian Fang and WenQuanYi contributors) and
Fixed-16x8 [public domain] bitmap fonts from X11 core fonts.

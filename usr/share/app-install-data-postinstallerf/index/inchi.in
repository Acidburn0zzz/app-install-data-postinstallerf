The IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChITM) is a non-proprietary
identifier for chemical substances that can be used in printed and
electronic data sources thus enabling easier linking of diverse data
compilations. It was developed under IUPAC Project 2000-025-1-800 during
the period 2000-2004. Details of the project and the history of its
progress are available from the project web site.

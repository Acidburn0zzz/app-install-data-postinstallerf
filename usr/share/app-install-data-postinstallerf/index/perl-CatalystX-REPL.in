Using CarpREPL with a Catalyst application is hard. Thats because of all
the internal exceptions that are being thrown and caught by Catalyst during
application startup. Youd have to manually skip over all of those.

This role works around that by automatically setting up CarpREPL after
starting your application, if the CATALYST_REPL or MYAPP_REPL environment
variables are set.

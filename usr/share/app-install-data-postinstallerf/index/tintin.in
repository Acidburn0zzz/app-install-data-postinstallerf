Comment3='
TinTin++, aka tt++, is a free MUD client for Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows. The
Windows port named WinTin++ (using the PuTTY terminal) is available for
those who do not use Cygwin (A Linux/Unix emulator for Windows) and runs on
Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7. Besides MUDs, TinTin++ also works
well with MUSH, Rogue, BBS, and Linux servers.

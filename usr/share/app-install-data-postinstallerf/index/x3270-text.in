The c3270 program opens a 3270 terminal which emulates the actual look of an
IBM 3278/3279 terminal, commonly used with mainframe applications.
x3270 also allows you to telnet to an IBM host from the x3270 window.

Install the x3270-text package if you need to access IBM hosts using an IBM
3278/3279 terminal emulator without running X.

Comment3='
CPAN module authors use a MANIFEST.SKIP file to exclude certain well known
files from getting put into a generated MANIFEST file, which would cause them
to go into the final distribution package.

The packaging tools try to automatically skip things for you, but if you add
one of your own entries, you have to add all the common ones yourself.  This
module attempts to make all of this boring process as simple and reliable as
possible.

Dasher is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by natural
continuous pointing gestures. Dasher is a competitive text-entry system
wherever a full-size keyboard cannot be used, e.g. when operating a computer
one-handed, by joystick, touchscreen, trackball, or mouse, when operating
a computer without hands (i.e. by head-mouse or by eyetracker), or on
palmtops or wearable computers.

Comment3='
Prints two six-monthly vertical-type daily planner (i.e.,
months along the top, days downwards), with each 6-month period
fitting onto a single A4 (or US letter) sheet. The package
offers support for English, French, German, Spanish and
Portuguese. The previous scheme of annual updates has now been
abandoned, in favour of a Perl script yplan that generates a
years planner automatically. (The last manually-generated
LaTeX file remains on the archive.)

Jemmy is a Java UI testing library. Jemmy represents the most natural way to
test Java UI - perform the testing right from the Java code. Jemmy is a Java
library which provides clear and straightforward API to access Java UI. Tests
are then just java programs, which use the API. Having the tests in Java allows
to use all the flexibility of high level language to capture test logic and
also do any other operations needed to be done from test.

The anonymizing relay monitor (arm) is a terminal status monitor for Tor relays,
intended for command-line aficionados, ssh connections, and anyone with a tty
terminal. This works much like top does for system usage, providing real time
statistics for

 - bandwidth, CPU, and memory usage
 - relays current configuration
 - logged events
 - connection details (IP, host name, fingerprint, and consensus data)
 - etc.

Scratch is a programming language that makes it easy to create your own
creations on the web.

As young people create and share Scratch projects, they learn important
mathematical and computational ideas, while also learning to think
creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively.
This package brings in all of the various subpackages which comprise the
full Scratch distribution.

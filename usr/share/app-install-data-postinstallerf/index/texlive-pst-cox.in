Pst-cox is a PSTricks package for drawing 2-dimensional
projections of complex regular polytopes (after the work of
Coxeter). The package consists of a macro library for drawing
the projections. The complex polytopes appear in the study of
the root systems and play a crucial role in many domains
related to mathematics and physics. These polytopes have been
completely described by Coxeter in his book "Regular Complex
Polytopes". There exist only a finite numbers of exceptional
regular complex polytopes (for example the icosahedron) and
some infinite series (for example, one can construct a multi-

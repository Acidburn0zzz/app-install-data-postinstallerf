Hyphenation patterns for Russian in T2A and UTF-8 encodings.
For 8-bit engines, the ruhyphen package provides a number of
different pattern sets, as well as different (8-bit) encodings,
that can be chosen at format-generation time.  The UTF-8
version only provides the default pattern set.  A mechanism
similar to the one used for 8-bit patterns may be implemented
in the future.

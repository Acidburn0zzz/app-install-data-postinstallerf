aliased is simple in concept but is a rather handy module. It loads the
class you specify and exports into your namespace a subroutine that returns
the class name. You can explicitly alias the class to another name or, if
you prefer, you can do so implicitly. In the latter case, the name of the
subroutine is the last part of the class name.

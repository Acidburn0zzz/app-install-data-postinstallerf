London Law is an online multiplayer version of a well known detective
boardgame. The game is unusually asymmetric; one player controls the movements
of the criminal Mr. X as he tries to evade the detectives, while another one to
five players control five detectives trying to track him down. Mr. X has an
advantage in access to transportation routes, and his precise location remains
hidden for most of the game. The detectives have only the advantage of superior
numbers, so they must work in concert to limit the criminals options. London
Law features an attractive map overlaid on high-resolution satellite imagery.

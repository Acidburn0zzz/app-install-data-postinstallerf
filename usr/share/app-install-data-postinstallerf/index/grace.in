Grace is a Motif application for two-dimensional data visualization.
Grace can transform the data using free equations, FFT, cross- and
auto-correlation, differences, integrals, histograms, and much
more. The generated figures are of high quality.  Grace is a very
convenient tool for data inspection, data transformation, and for
making figures for publications.

GParted stands for Gnome Partition Editor and is a graphical frontend to
libparted. Among other features it supports creating, resizing, moving
and copying of partitions. Also several (optional) filesystem tools provide
support for filesystems not included in libparted. These optional packages
will be detected at runtime and dont require a rebuild of GParted

Comment3='
SIP is a tool for generating bindings for C++ classes so that they can be
accessed as normal Python classes. SIP takes many of its ideas from SWIG but,
because it is specifically designed for C++ and Python, is able to generate
tighter bindings. SIP is so called because it is a small SWIG.

SIP was originally designed to generate Python bindings for KDE and so has
explicit support for the signal slot mechanism used by the Qt/KDE class
libraries. However, SIP can be used to generate Python bindings for any C++
class library.

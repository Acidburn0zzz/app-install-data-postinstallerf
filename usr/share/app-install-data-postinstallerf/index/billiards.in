Billiards is a free cue sports simulator. It aims for physical accuracy and
simplicity and should hopefully be useful for practicing  billiards on your
own and against your friends when a real pool table is not available.
Currently both a pool table and a billiards table (that is with and without
pockets) are implemented allowing you to play eightball, nineball and carom
billiards games.

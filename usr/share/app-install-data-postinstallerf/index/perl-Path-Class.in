Comment3='
PathClass is a module for manipulation of file and directory specifications
(strings describing their locations, like /home/ken/foo.txt or
C\Windows\Foo.txt) in a cross-platform manner. It supports pretty much every
platform Perl runs on, including Unix, Windows, Mac, VMS, Epoc, Cygwin, OS/2,
and NetWare.

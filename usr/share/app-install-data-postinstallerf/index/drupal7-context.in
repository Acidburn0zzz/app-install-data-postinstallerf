Context allows you to manage contextual conditions and reactions for different
portions of your site. You can think of each context as representing a "section"
of your site. For each context, you can choose the conditions that trigger this
context to be active and choose different aspects of Drupal that should react to
this active context.

Think of conditions as a set of rules that are checked during page load to see
what context is active. Any reactions that are associated with active contexts
are then fired.

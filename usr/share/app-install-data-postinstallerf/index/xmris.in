You control a gnome, who can walk around a garden, along paths  already
marked,  or  create  new paths wherever you wish. You also have a ball,
which can be thrown in the direction youre facing, towards the gnomes
feet.  Points  are scored for collecting cherries (if you collect eight
cherries without stopping or  pushing  an  apple,  you  get  a  bonus),
killing monsters (by squashing them, or throwing the ball at them), and
collecting the prize left when all the monsters have come out of  their
den.

C-Dogs SDL is a port of the old DOS arcade game C-Dogs to modern operating
systems utilising the SDL Media Libraries. C-Dogs is an arcade shoot-em-up
which lets players work alone and cooperatively during missions or fight
against each other in the ?dogfight? deathmatch mode. The DOS version of
C-Dogs came with several built in missions and dogfight maps. This version
does too. The author of the DOS version of C-Dogs was Ronny Wester. We would
like to thank Ronny for releasing the C-Dogs sources to the public.

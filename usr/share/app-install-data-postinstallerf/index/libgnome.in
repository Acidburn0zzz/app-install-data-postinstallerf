GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment) is a user-friendly set of
GUI applications and desktop tools to be used in conjunction with a
window manager for the X Window System. The libgnome package includes
non-GUI-related libraries that are needed to run GNOME. The libgnomeui
package contains X11-dependent GNOME library features.

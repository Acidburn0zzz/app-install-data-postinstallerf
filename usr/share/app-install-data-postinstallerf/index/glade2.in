Comment3='
The glade2 package contains a legacy version of Glade for GTK+ 2.x. Do not use
it for new projects, use glade (for GTK+ 3.x) or glade3 (for GTK+ 2.x) instead.

Glade is a free user interface builder for GTK+ and the GNOME GUI
desktop. Glade can produce C source code. Support for C++, Ada95,
Python, and Perl is also available, via external tools which process
the XML interface description files output by GLADE.

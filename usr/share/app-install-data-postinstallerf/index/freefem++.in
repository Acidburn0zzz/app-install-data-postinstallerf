A PDE oriented language using Finite Element Method FreeFem++ is an
implementation of a language dedicated to the finite element method. It
provides you a way to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDE) simply.

Problems involving partial differential equations (pde) of  several
branches of physics such as fluid-structure interactions require
interpolations of data on several meshes and their manipulation within
one program.
FreeFem++ is an extension of freefem, freefem+ written in C++.

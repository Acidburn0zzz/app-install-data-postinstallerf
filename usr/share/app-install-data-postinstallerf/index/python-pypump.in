Pump.io is a socially oriented federated network. It provides a way to post
notes and images as well and subscribe to other people to get updates on
what they post.

PyPump provides an interface to the pump.io APIs. The aim is to provide
very natural pythonic representations of Notes, Images, People, etc...
allowing you to painlessly interact with them.

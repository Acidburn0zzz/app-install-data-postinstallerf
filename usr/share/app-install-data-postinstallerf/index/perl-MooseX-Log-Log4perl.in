Comment3='
A logging role building a very lightweight wrapper to LogLog4perl for use
with your the Moose classes. The initialization of the Log4perl instance must
be performed prior to logging the first log message. Otherwise the default
initialization will happen, probably not doing the things you expect.

For compatibility the logger attribute can be accessed to use a common
interface for application logging.
For simple logging needs use MooseXLogLog4perlEasy to directly add
log_<level> methods to your class instance.

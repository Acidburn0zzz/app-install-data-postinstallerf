DigestBubbleBabble takes a message digest (generated by either of the MD5 or
SHA-1 message digest algorithms) and creates a fingerprint of that digest in
"bubble babble" format. Bubble babble is a method of representing a message
digest as a string of "real" words, to make the fingerprint easier to remember.
The "words" are not necessarily real words, but they look more like words than
a string of hex characters.

Bubble babble fingerprinting is used by the SSH2 suite (and, consequently, by
NetSSHPerl, the Perl SSH implementation) to display easy-to-remember key
fingerprints. The key (a DSA or RSA key) is converted into a textual form,

This package adds an Option type for PHP.

The Option type is intended for cases where you sometimes might return a value
(typically an object), and sometimes you might return no value (typically null)
depending on arguments, or other runtime factors.
Often times, you forget to handle the case where no value is returned. Not
intentionally of course, but maybe you did not account for all possible states
of the system; or maybe you indeed covered all cases, then time goes on, code
is refactored, some of these your checks might become invalid, or incomplete.

NetPingExternal is a module which interfaces with the "ping" command on
many systems. It presently provides a single function, ping(), that takes
in a hostname and (optionally) a timeout and returns true if the host is
alive, and false otherwise. Unless you have the ability (and willingness)
to run your scripts as the superuser on your system, this module will
probably provide more accurate results than NetPing will.

OpenStack Compute (codename Nova) is open source software designed to
provision and manage large networks of virtual machines, creating a
redundant and scalable cloud computing platform. It gives you the
software, control panels, and APIs required to orchestrate a cloud,
including running instances, managing networks, and controlling access
through users and projects. OpenStack Compute strives to be both
hardware and hypervisor agnostic, currently supporting a variety of
standard hardware configurations and seven major hypervisors.

This package contains the Nova service for managing certificates.

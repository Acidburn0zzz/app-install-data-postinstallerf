Bluetile is a tiling window manager for Linux, designed to integrate with
the GNOME desktop environment. It provides both a traditional, stacking layout
mode as well as tiling layouts where windows are arranged to use the entire
screen without overlapping. Bluetile tries to make the tiling paradigm easily
accessible to users coming from traditional window managers by drawing on known
conventions and providing both mouse and keyboard access for all features.

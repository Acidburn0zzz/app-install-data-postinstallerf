This module provides an interface to libev
(<http//software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html>). While the included documentation
is comprehensive, one might also consult the documentation of libev itself
(<http//cvs.schmorp.de/libev/ev.html>) for more subtle details on watcher
semantics or some discussion on the available backends, or how to force a
specific backend with "LIBEV_FLAGS", or just about in any case because it has
much more detailed information.

fast_xs provides C extensions for escaping text.
The original String#fast_xs method is based on the xchar code by Sam Ruby

_why also packages an older version with Hpricot (patches submitted).
The version here should be compatible with the latest version of Hpricot
code.
Ruby on Rails will automatically use String#fast_xs from either Hpricot
or this gem version with the bundled Builder package.
String#fast_xs is an almost exact translation of Sam Rubys original

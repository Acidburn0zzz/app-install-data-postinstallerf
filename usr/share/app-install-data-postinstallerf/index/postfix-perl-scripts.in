This package contains perl scripts pflogsumm and qshape.

Pflogsumm is a log analyzer/summarizer for the Postfix MTA. It is
designed to provide an over-view of Postfix activity. Pflogsumm
generates summaries and, in some cases, detailed reports of mail
server traffic volumes, rejected and bounced email, and server
warnings, errors and panics.
qshape prints Postfix queue domain and age distribution.

OpenAttestation (OAT) is a open source project providing a SDK for managing
host integrity verification using TCG-defined remote attestation protocol,
targeting to be integrated into cloud and enterprise management tools.

This package provides the host agent which uses Java and the NIARL TPM
Module to acquire integrity measurement data from the hosts Trusted
Platform Module (TPM).
The data is compiled into an integrity report and sent to the OAT appraisal
server.

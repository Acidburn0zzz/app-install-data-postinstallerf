The net-snmp-devel package contains the development libraries and
header files for use with the NET-SNMP projects network management
tools.

Install the net-snmp-devel package if you would like to develop
applications for use with the NET-SNMP projects network management
tools. Youll also need to have the net-snmp and net-snmp-utils
packages installed.

duply deals as a wrapper for the mighty duplicity magic. It simplifies
running duplicity with cron or on command line by

- keeping recurring settings in profiles per backup job
- enabling batch operations e.g. backup_verify_purge
- executing pre/post scripts
- precondition checking for flawless duplicity operation
Since version 1.5.0 all duplicity backends are supported. Hence the
name changed from ftplicity to duply.

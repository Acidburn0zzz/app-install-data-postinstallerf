Comment='<span size="xx-large">Binary serialization library</span>'
Comment3='
A binary serialization library, similar to binary, that introduces an isolate
primitive for parser isolation, and replaces the asynchronous errors with a
user-handleable Either type.  Similar to binary in performance, but uses a
strict ByteString instead of a lazy ByteString, thus restricting it to
operating on finite inputs.

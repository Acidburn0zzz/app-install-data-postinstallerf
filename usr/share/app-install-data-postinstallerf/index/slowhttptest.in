SlowHTTPTest is a highly configurable tool that simulates some Application
Layer Denial of Service attacks. It implements most common low-bandwidth
Application Layer DoS attacks, such as slow-loris, Slow HTTP POST, Slow Read
attack (based on TCP persist timer exploit) by draining concurrent connections
pool, as well as Apache Range Header attack by causing very significant memory
and CPU usage on the server.

Comment3='
NES NTSC video filter library. Pixel artifacts and color mixing play an
important role in NES games console graphics. Accepts pixels in native 6-bit
NES palette format, or a 9-bit format that includes the three color emphasis
bits in PPU register $2001. Can also output an RGB palette for use in a
regular blitter

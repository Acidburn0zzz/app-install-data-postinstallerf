Xaw3d is an enhanced version of the MIT Athena widget set for
the X Window System.  Xaw3d adds a three-dimensional look to those
applications with minimal or no source code changes. Xaw3d-devel includes
the header files and libraries for developing programs that take full
advantage of Xaw3ds features.

You should install Xaw3d-devel if you are going to develop applications
using the Xaw3d widget set.  Youll also need to install the Xaw3d
package.

QComicBook is a viewer for PDF files and comic book archives containing
jpeg/png/xpm/gif/bmp images, which aims at convenience and simplicity.
Features include automatic unpacking of archive files, full-screen mode, continuous
scrolling mode, double-pages viewing, manga mode, thumbnails view, page scaling,
mouse or keyboard navigation etc.

You will also need unzip, rar (or unrar), unace, p7zip and tar (with gzip and
bzip2 support compiled in) somewhere in your PATH to handle archives. If one of
these tools is missing you can still use QComicBook, but you wont be able to
open some archives. You may check status of supported archives via Help > System information

pork is an ncurses-based AOL instant messenger client. It uses the
OSCAR protocol (the one the windows client uses) to access AIM. Pork
features Perl scripting; an online help system; the ability to
configure nearly all aspects of the programs look-and-feel; an alias
system; and a powerful, fully-configurable key binding system. It
supports being logged in with more than one screen name at the same
time. The default look-and-feel of the client is modeled after the
ircII IRC client. Anyone comfortable using ircII (or any clients
pork.

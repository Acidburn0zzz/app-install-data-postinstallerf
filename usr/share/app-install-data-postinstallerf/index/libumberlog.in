Comment3='
The libumberlog library serves two purposes its either a drop-in
replacement for the syslog() system call, in which case it turns
the default syslog messages into CEE-enhanced messages, with a CEE-JSON
payload, and some automatically discovered fields. Or, it can be used
as a stand-alone library, that provides a syslog()-like API, with
the ability to add arbitrary key-value pairs to the resulting JSON payload.

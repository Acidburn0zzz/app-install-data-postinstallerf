Comment3='
The ocamldsort command scans a set of Objective Caml source files (.ml
and .mli files), sorts them according to their dependencies and prints
the sorted files in order to link their corresponding .cmo files.

For ocamldsort to work it must get a list of dependencies generated by
ocamldep, if the standard input to ocamldsort has been redirected then
ocamldsort assumes that this is a dependency file generated by
ocamldep. Otherwise ocamldsort calls ocamldep to generate the
dependency list itself. In either case the source files to be sorted
should be given as arguments to the ocamldsort command.

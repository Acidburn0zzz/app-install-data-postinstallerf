Several electrical symbols like resistor, capacitor,
transistors etc., are defined. The symbols can be connected
with wires. The package also contains an American resistor
symbol for those of us on that side of the Atlantic. The
package also has simple facilities for producing optics
diagrams; however, no-one would deny that the PSTricks pst-
optic package, or the MetaPost makecirc package does the job
better.

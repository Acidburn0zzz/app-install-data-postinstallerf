The Failsafe Plugin is designed to run integration tests while the
Surefire Plugins is designed to run unit. The name (failsafe) was
chosen both because it is a synonym of surefire and because it implies
that when it fails, it does so in a safe way.

If you use the Surefire Plugin for running tests, then when you have a
test failure, the build will stop at the integration-test phase and
your integration test environment will not have been torn down
correctly.

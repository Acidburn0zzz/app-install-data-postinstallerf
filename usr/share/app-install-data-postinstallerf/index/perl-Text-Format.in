The format routine will format under all circumstances even if the width isnt
enough to contain the longest words. TextWrap will die under these
circumstances, although I am told this is fixed. If columns is set to a small
number and words are longer than that and the leading whitespace than there
will be a single word on each line. This will let you make a simple word list
which could be indented or right aligned. There is a chance for croaking if you
try to subvert the module. If you dont pass in text then the internal text is
worked on, though not modified. TextFormat is meant for more powerful text
formatting than TextWrap allows.

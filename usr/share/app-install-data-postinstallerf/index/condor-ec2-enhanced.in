The EC2 Enhanced feature allows for near seamless translation of Condor jobs
in the vanilla universe to condor EC2 jobs in the grid universe.  For all
intents and purposes, the job runs as any vanilla universe job runs except
on an Amazon EC2 AMI instance.

This package contains the daemon that handles the communication between
Condor and the Amazon Web Services (AWS).  This should be installed on an
Amazon Machine Instance (AMI) that will be used with Condors EC2 Enhanced
feature.

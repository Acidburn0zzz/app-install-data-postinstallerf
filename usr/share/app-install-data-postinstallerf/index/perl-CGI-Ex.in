CGIEx provides a suite of utilities to make writing CGI scripts more
enjoyable. Although they can all be used separately, the main functionality
of each of the modules is best represented in the CGIExApp module.
CGIExApp takes CGI application building to the next step. CGIExApp
is not quite a framework (which normally includes pre-built html) instead
CGIExApp is an extended application flow that dramatically reduces CGI
build time in most cases. It does so using as little magic as possible. See
CGIExApp.

Comment3='
SendmailPMilter is a mail filtering API implementing the Sendmail milter
protocol in pure Perl. This allows Sendmail servers (and perhaps other MTAs
implementing milter) to filter and modify mail in transit during the SMTP
connection, all in Perl.

It should be noted that PMilter 0.90 and later is NOT compatible with
scripts written for PMilter 0.5 and earlier.  The API has been reworked
significantly, and the enhanced APIs and rule logic provided by PMilter
0.5 and earlier has been factored out for inclusion in a separate package
called MailMilter.

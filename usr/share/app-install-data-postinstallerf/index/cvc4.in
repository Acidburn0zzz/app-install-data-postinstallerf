CVC4 is an efficient open-source automatic theorem prover for
satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) problems.  It can be used to prove
the validity (or, dually, the satisfiability) of first-order formulas in
a large number of built-in logical theories and their combination.

CVC4 is the fourth in the Cooperating Validity Checker family of tools
(CVC, CVC Lite, CVC3) but does not directly incorporate code from any
previous version.  A joint project of NYU and U Iowa, CVC4 aims to
support the  features of CVC3 and SMT-LIBv2 while optimizing the design
of the core system architecture and decision procedures to take

The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is normally used only for
booting diskless workstations.  The tftp package provides the user
interface for TFTP, which allows users to transfer files to and from a
remote machine.  This program and TFTP provide very little security,
and should not be enabled unless it is expressly needed.

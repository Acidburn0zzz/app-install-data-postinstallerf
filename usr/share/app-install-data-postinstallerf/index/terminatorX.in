terminatorX is a real-time audio synthesizer that allows you to "scratch" on
digitally sampled audio data (*.wav, *.au, *.ogg, *.mp3, etc.) the way
hiphop-DJs scratch on vinyl records. It features multiple turntables, real-time
effects (buit-in as well as LADSPA plug-in effects), a sequencer and an
easy-to-use gtk+ GUI.

Comment3='
A clone of legendary game made by Geoffrey Silverton in 1991. In the game
two players using the same keyboard and the same screen each control an
underground tank. Goal is to find and destroy the opponents tank. Since
only small part of the map is displayed on the split screen, you might
actually have some searching to do.

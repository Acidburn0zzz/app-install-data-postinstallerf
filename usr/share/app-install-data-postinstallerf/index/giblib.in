Comment3='
giblib is a utility library used by many of the applications from
linuxbrit.co.uk. It incorporates doubly linked lists, some string
functions, and a wrapper for imlib2. The wrapper does two things.
It gives you access to fontstyles, which can be loaded from files,
saved to files or defined dynamically through the API. It also,
and more importantly, wraps imlib2s context API.

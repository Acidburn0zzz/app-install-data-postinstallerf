Comment3='
A window-matching utility, inspired by Sawfishs "Matched Windows" option and
the lack such functionality in Metacity. Devils Pie can be configured to
detect windows as they are created, and match the window to a set of rules. If
the window matches the rules, it can perform a series of actions on that
window.

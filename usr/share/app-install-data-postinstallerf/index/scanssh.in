ScanSSH supports scanning a list of addresses and networks for open proxies,
SSH protocol servers, Web and SMTP servers. Where possible ScanSSH, displays
the version number of the running services. ScanSSH protocol scanner supports
random selection of IP addresses from large network ranges and is useful for
gathering statistics on the deployment of SSH protocol servers in a company
or the Internet as whole.

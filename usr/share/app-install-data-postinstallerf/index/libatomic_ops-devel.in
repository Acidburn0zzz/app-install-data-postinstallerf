Comment3='
Provides implementations for atomic memory update operations on a
number of architectures. This allows direct use of these in reasonably
portable code. Unlike earlier similar packages, this one explicitly
considers memory barrier semantics, and allows the construction of code
that involves minimum overhead across a variety of architectures.

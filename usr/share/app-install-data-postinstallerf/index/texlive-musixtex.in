MusiXTeX provides a set of macros, based on the earlier
MusicTeX, for typesetting music with TeX. To produce optimal
spacing, MusixTeX is a three-pass system etex, musixflx, and
etex again. (Musixflx is a lua script that is provided in the
bundle.) The three-pass process, optionally followed by

version of MusixTeX builds upon work by Andreas Egler, whose
own version is no longer being developed. The MusiXTeX macros

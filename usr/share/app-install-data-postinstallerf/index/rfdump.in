RFDump is a tool to detect RFID-Tags and show their meta information
Tag ID, Tag Type, manufacturer etc. The user data memory of a tag can
be displayed and modified using either a Hex or an ASCII editor. Tag
contents can be stored and loaded using a specific XML fomrat. This
effectively allows to copy data from one tag to another. In addition,
the integrated cookie feature demonstrates how easy it is for a
company to abuse RFID technology to spy on their customers.  RFDump
works with the ACG Multi-Tag Reader or similar card reader hardware.

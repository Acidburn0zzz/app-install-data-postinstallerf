Ever wished the wrist-handiness of shell scripts be put into a real programming
language? Say hello to Plumbum Shell Combinators. Plumbum (Latin for lead,
which was used to create pipes back in the day) is a small yet feature-rich
library for shell script-like programs in Python. The motto of the library is
"Never write shell scripts again", and thus it attempts to mimic the shell
syntax ("shell combinators") where it makes sense, while keeping it all
pythonic and cross-platform.

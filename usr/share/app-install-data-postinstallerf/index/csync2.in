Comment3='
Csync2 is a cluster synchronization tool. It can be used to keep files on
multiple hosts in a cluster in sync. Csync2 can handle complex setups with
much more than just 2 hosts, handle file deletions and can detect conflicts.
It is expedient for HA-clusters, HPC-clusters, COWs and server farms.

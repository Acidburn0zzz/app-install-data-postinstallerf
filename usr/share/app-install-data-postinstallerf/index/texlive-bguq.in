Comment3='
The font contains a single character the Begriffsschrift
quantifier (in several sizes), as used to set the
Begriffsschrift (concept notation) of Frege. The font is not
intended for end users; instead it is expected that it will be
used by other packages which implement the Begriffsschrift. An
(unofficial) modified version of Josh Parsons begriff is
included as an example of implementation.

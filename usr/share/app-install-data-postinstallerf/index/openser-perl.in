The time needed when writing a new OpenSER module unfortunately is quite
high, while the options provided by the configuration file are limited to
the features implemented in the modules. With this Perl module, you can
easily implement your own OpenSER extensions in Perl.  This allows for
simple access to the full world of CPAN modules. SIP URI rewriting could be
implemented based on regular expressions; accessing arbitrary data backends,
e.g. LDAP or Berkeley DB files, is now extremely simple.

The volume is one of the central properties of a convex body, and volume
computation is involved in many hard problems.  Applications range from
rather classical ones as in convex optimization to problems in remote
fields like algebraic geometry where the number of common roots of
polynomials can be related to a special polytope volume.

Part of the fascination of the subject stems from the discrepancy
between the intuitive notion of "volume" and the actual hardness of
computing it.  Despite this discouraging complexity - algorithms in
general need exponential time in the input dimension - steadily growing

Verbasef allows you to input (subsections of a) file, print
them in verbatim mode, while automatically breaking up the
inputted lines into pieces of a given length, which are output
as figures. These figures are posted using the [H]
specification, which forces LaTeX to place the figure at the
spot of invocation, rather than floating the figures to the top
of the next page. The package requires the verbatim, here and
vrbexin packages.

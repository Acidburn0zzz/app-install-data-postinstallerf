Warzone 2100 was an innovative 3D real-time strategy game back in 1999, and
most will agree it didnt enjoy the commercial success it should have had. The
games source code was liberated on December 6th, 2004, under a GPL license
(see COPYING in this directory for details). Soon after that, the Warzone 2100
ReDev project was formed to take care of its future.

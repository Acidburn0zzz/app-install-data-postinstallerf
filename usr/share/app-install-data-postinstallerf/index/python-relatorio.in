Comment3='
A templating library which provides a way to easily output all kind of
different files (odt, ods, png, svg, ...). Adding support for more filetype
is easy you just have to create a plugin for this.

relatorio also provides a report repository allowing you to link python
objects and report together, find reports by mimetypes/name/python objects.

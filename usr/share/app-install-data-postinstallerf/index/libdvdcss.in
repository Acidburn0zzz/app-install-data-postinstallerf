Comment3='
libdvdcss is a cross-platform library for transparent DVD device
access with on-the-fly CSS decryption. It currently runs under Linux,
FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, BSD/OS, Solaris, BeOS, Win95/Win98,
Win2k/WinXP, MacOS X, HP-UX, QNX, and OS/2. It is used by libdvdread
and most DVD players such as VLC because of its portability and
because, unlike similar libraries, it does not require your DVD drive
to be region locked.

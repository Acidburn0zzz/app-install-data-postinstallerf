JFlex is a lexical analyzer generator (also known as scanner
generator) for Java, written in Java.  It is also a rewrite of the
very useful tool JLex which was developed by Elliot Berk at Princeton
University.  As Vern Paxson states for his C/C++ tool flex They do
not share any code though.  JFlex is designed to work together with
the LALR parser generator CUP by Scott Hudson, and the Java
modification of Berkeley Yacc BYacc/J by Bob Jamison.  It can also be
used together with other parser generators like ANTLR or as a
standalone tool.

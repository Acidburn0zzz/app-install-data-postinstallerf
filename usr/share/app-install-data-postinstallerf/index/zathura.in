Zathura is a highly customizable and functional document viewer.
It provides a minimalistic and space saving interface as well as
an easy usage that mainly focuses on keyboard interaction.

Zathura requires plugins to support document formats.
For instance
* zathura-pdf-poppler to open PDF files,
* zathura-ps to open PostScript files,
* zathura-djvu to open DjVu files.
All of these are available as separate packages in Fedora.

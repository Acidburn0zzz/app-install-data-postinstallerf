Comment3='
Xfce XKB layout switch plugin for the Xfce panel. It displays the current
keyboard layout, and refreshes when layout changes. The layout can be
switched by simply clicking on the plugin. For now the keyboard layouts
cannot be configured from the plugin itself, they should be set in the
XF86Config file or some other way (e.g. setxkbmap).

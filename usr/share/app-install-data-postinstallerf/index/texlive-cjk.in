CJK is a macro package for LaTeX, providing simultaneous
support for various Asian scripts in many encodings (including
Unicode) - Chinese (both traditional and simplified), -
Japanese, - Korean and - Thai. A special add-on feature is an
interface to the Emacs editor (cjk-enc.el) which gives
simultaneous, easy-to-use support to a bunch of other scripts
in addition to the above - Cyrillic, - Greek, - Latin-based
scripts, - Russian and - Vietnamese.

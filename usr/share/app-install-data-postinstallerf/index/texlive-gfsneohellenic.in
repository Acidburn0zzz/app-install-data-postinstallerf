Comment='<span size="xx-large">A Greek font in the Neo-Hellenic style</span>'
Comment3='
The NeoHellenic style evolved in academic circles in the 19th
and 20th century; the present font follows a cut commissioned
from Monotype in 1927. The present version was provided by the
Greek Font Society. The font supports both Greek and Latin
characters, and has been adjusted to work well with the
cmbright fonts for mathematics support. LaTeX support of the
fonts is provided, offering OT1, T1 and LGR encodings.

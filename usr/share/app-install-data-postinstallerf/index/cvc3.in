CVC3 is an automatic theorem prover for Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)
problems.  It can be used to prove the validity (or, dually, the
satisfiability) of first-order formulas in a large number of built-in logical
theories and their combination.

CVC3 is the latest offspring of a series of popular SMT provers, which
originated at Stanford University with the SVC system.  In particular, it
builds on the code base of CVC Lite, its most recent predecessor.  Its high
level design follows that of the Sammy prover.

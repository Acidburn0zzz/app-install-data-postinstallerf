MESS is an acronym that stands for Multi Emulator Super System. MESS will
more or less faithfully reproduce computer and console systems on a PC.

MESS emulates the hardware of the systems and sometimes utilizes ROM images to
load programs and games.  Therefore, these systems are NOT simulations, but
the actual emulations of the hardware.

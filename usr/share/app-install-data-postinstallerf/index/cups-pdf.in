"cups-pdf" is a backend script for use with CUPS - the "Common UNIX Printing
System" (see more for CUPS under http//www.cups.org/).
"cups-pdf" uses the ghostscript pdfwrite device to produce PDF Files.

This version has been modified to store the PDF files on the Desktop of the
user. This behavior can be changed by editing the configuration file.

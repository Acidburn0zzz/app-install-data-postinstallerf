The linearA package provides a simple interface to two fonts
which include all known symbols, simple and complex, of the
Linear A script. This way one can easily replicate Linear A
"texts" using modern typographic technology. Note that the
Linear A script has not been deciphered yet and probably never
will be deciphered.

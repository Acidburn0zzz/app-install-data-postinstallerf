A collection of tools for network auditing and penetration testing. Dsniff,
filesnarf, mailsnarf, msgsnarf, urlsnarf and webspy allow to passively monitor
a network for interesting data (passwords, e-mail, files). Arpspoof, dnsspoof
and macof facilitate the interception of network traffic normally unavailable
to an attacker (e.g, due to layer-2 switching). Sshmitm and webmitm implement
active monkey-in-the-middle attacks against redirected SSH and HTTPS sessions
by exploiting weak bindings in ad-hoc PKI.

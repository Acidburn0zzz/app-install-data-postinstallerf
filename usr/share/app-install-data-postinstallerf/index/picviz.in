Picviz is a parallel coordinates plotter which enables easy scripting
from various input (tcpdump, syslog, iptables logs, apache logs,
etc..) to visualize your data and discover interesting results
quickly.

Its primary goal is to graph data in order to be able to quickly
analyze problems and find correlations among variables. With security
analysis in mind, the program has been designed to be very flexible,
able to graph millions of events.

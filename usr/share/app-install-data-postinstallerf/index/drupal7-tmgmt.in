Comment3='
The Translation Management Tool (TMGMT) module provides a tool set for
translating content from different sources. The translation can be done
by people or translation services of all kinds. It builds on and uses
existing language tools and data structures in Drupal and can be used
in automated workflow scenarios.

This module does not make i18n or any other language module for Drupal
obsolete. It does only facilitate the translation process.
The second alpha has been released, huge improvements have been made

xmltodict is a Python module that makes working with XML feel like you are
working with JSON.  Its very fast (Expat-based) and has a streaming mode
with a small memory footprint, suitable for big XML dumps like Discogs or
Wikipedia.

    >>> doc = xmltodict.parse("""

    ...   <and>
    ...     <many>elements</many>
    ...     <many>more elements</many>

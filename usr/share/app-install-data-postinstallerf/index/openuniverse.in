OpenUniverse is a space simulator.  It currently focusses on the Solar
System and lets you visit all of its planets, major moons and a vast
collection of smaller bodies in colorful, glorious and realtime 3D.

If youve ever had a chance to visit Mercury or asteroid Geographos, here
youll find them looking exactly the same way, following exactly the same
path as when youve left them.

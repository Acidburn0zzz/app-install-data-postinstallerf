KMetronome is a MIDI metronome with KDE interface, based on the ALSA
sequencer. The intended audience is musicians and music students. Like
solid, real metronomes it is a tool to keep the rhythm while playing musical
instruments. It uses MIDI for sound generation instead of digital audio,
allowing low CPU usage, and very accurate timing thanks to the ALSA sequencer.

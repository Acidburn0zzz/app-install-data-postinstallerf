Comment3='
The TracNav macro implements a fully customizable navigation bar for
the Trac wiki engine. The contents of the navigation bar is a wiki
page itself and can be edited like any other wiki page through the web
interface. The navigation bar supports hierarchical ordering of
topics. The design of TracNav mimics the design of the TracGuideToc
that was originally supplied with Trac.

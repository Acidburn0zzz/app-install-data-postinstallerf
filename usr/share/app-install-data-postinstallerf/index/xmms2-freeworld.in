XMMS2 is an audio framework, but it is not a general multimedia player - it
will not play videos. It has a modular framework and plugin architecture for
audio processing, visualisation and output, but this framework has not been
designed to support video. Also the client-server design of XMMS2 (and the
daemon being independent of any graphics output) practically prevents direct
video output being implemented. It has support for a wide range of audio
formats, which is expandable via plugins. It includes a basic CLI interface
to the XMMS2 framework, but most users will want to install a graphical XMMS2
client (such as gxmms2 or esperanza).

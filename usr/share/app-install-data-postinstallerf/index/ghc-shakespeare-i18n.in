This package uses a compile-time, type-safe approach to create translated
content. It has a simple syntax for translators, while allowing the full power
of Haskell for applying complex grammar rules.

This package was spun off from yesod-core, and therefore the Yesod
documentation is a good place to start in understanding this package.
Please see <http//www.yesodweb.com/book/shakespearean-templates> for more
information.

The features module enables the capture
and management of features in Drupal.
A feature is a collection of Drupal entities
which taken together satisfy a certain use-case.

Features provides a UI and API for taking different site building components
from modules with exportables and
bundling them together in a single feature module.
A feature module is like any other Drupal module except
that it declares its components (e.g. views, contexts, CCK fields, etc.)

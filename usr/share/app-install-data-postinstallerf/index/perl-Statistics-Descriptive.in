Comment3='
This module provides basic functions used in descriptive statistics. It has
an object oriented design and supports two different types of data storage
and calculation objects sparse and full. With the sparse method, none of
the data is stored and only a few statistical measures are available. Using
the full method, the entire data set is retained and additional functions
are available.

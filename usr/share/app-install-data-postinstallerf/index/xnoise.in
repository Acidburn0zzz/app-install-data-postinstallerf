Xnoise is a Gtk+ media player with a tracklist-centric design. The
tracklist is a list of video or music tracks that are played one by
one without being removed (right side of window). This gives you the
possibility to enqueue any track in any order, regardless if they are
on the same album or not. The tracks can be reordered at any time by
using drag and drop.

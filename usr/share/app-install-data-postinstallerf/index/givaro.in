Givaro is a C++ library for arithmetic and algebraic computations.
Its main features are implementations of the basic arithmetic of many
mathematical entities Primes fields, Extensions Fields, Finite Fields,
Finite Rings, Polynomials, Algebraic numbers, Arbitrary precision
integers and rationals (C++ wrappers over gmp) It also provides
data-structures and templated classes for the manipulation of basic
algebraic objects, such as vectors, matrices (dense, sparse, structured),
univariate polynomials (and therefore recursive multivariate).

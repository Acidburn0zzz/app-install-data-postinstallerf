EasyRdf is a PHP library designed to make it easy to consume and produce RDF
(http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework). It was designed
for use in mixed teams of experienced and inexperienced RDF developers. It is
written in Object Oriented PHP and has been tested extensively using PHPUnit.

After parsing EasyRdf builds up a graph of PHP objects that can then be walked
around to get the data to be placed on the page. Dump methods are available to
inspect what data is available during development.
Data is typically loaded into a EasyRdf_Graph object from source RDF documents,
loaded from the web via HTTP. The EasyRdf_GraphStore class simplifies loading
and saving data to a SPARQL 1.1 Graph Store.

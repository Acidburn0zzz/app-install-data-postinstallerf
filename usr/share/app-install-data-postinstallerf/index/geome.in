geome queries NetworkManager for its wifi information, such as ESSIDs
and signal strength, and sends it to Google Location to obtain your
geographic location.
It can return all of the information Google returns, or with the -s
flag, only return the latitude/longitude. This last mode is used by
the Pidgin OTR nearby friends plugin.

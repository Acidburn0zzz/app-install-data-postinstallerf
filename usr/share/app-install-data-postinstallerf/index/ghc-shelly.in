Shelly provides convenient systems programming in Haskell, similar in spirit to
POSIX shells. Shelly

* is aimed at convenience and getting things done rather than being a
demonstration of elegance.
* has detailed and useful error messages
* maintains its own environment, making it thread-safe.
* is modern, using Text and system-filepath/system-fileio
An overview is available in the README

DyLP is an implementation of the dynamic simplex algorithm. Briefly, dynamic
simplex attempts to work with an active constraint system which is a subset
of the full constraint system. It alternates between primal and dual simplex
phases. Between simplex phases, it deactivates variables and constraints
which are not currently useful, and scans the full constraint system to
activate variables and constraints which have become useful.

OpenStack Image Service (code-named Glance) provides discovery, registration,
and delivery services for virtual disk images. The Image Service API server
provides a standard REST interface for querying information about virtual disk
images stored in a variety of back-end stores, including OpenStack Object
Storage. Clients can register new virtual disk images with the Image Service,
query for information on publicly available disk images, and use the Image
Services client library for streaming virtual disk images.

This package contains the API and registry servers.

Turbolinks makes following links in your web application faster. Instead of
letting the browser recompile the JavaScript and CSS between each page change,
it keeps the current page instance alive and replaces only the body and
the title in the head. Think CGI vs persistent process. (Use with Rails Asset
Pipeline.)

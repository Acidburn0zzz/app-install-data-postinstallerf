This project develops a few extensions to complement JSR-173 StAX API in the
following area.

* Enable parser instance reuse (which is important in the
  high-performance environment like JAXB and JAX-WS)
* Improve the support for reading from non-text XML infoset,
  such as FastInfoset.
* Improve the namespace support.

Comment3='
In a document with a lot of diagrams created with PGF/TikZ,
there is a possibility of the reader being distracted by
different sorts of arrowheads in the diagrams and in the text
(as, e.g., in \rightarrow). The package defines macros to
create all arrows using PGF/TikZ, so as to avoid the problem.

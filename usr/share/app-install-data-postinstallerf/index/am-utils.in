Am-utils includes an updated version of Amd, the popular BSD
automounter.  An automounter is a program which maintains a cache
of mounted filesystems.  Filesystems are mounted when they are
first referenced by the user and unmounted after a certain period of
inactivity. Amd supports a variety of filesystems, including NFS, UFS,
CD-ROMS and local drives.

You should install am-utils if you need a program for automatically
mounting and unmounting filesystems.

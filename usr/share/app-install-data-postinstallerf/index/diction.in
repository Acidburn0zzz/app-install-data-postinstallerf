Diction and style are two old standard UNIX commands. Diction identifies wordy
and commonly misused phrases. Style analyses surface characteristics of a
document, including sentence length and other readability measures.

These programs cannot help you structure a document well, but they can help to
avoid poor wording and compare the readability (not the understandability!) of
your documents with others. Both commands support English and German documents.

Flam3, or Fractal Flames, are algorithmically generated images and animations.
This is free software to render fractal flames as described on
http//flam3.com. Flam3-animate makes animations, and flam3-render makes still
images. Flam3-genome creates and manipulates genomes (parameter sets). This
package contains a header file for C, a library, and a pkgconfig file.

The idxlayout package offers a key-value interface to configure
index layout parameters, e.g. allowing for three-column indexes
or for "parent" items and their affiliated subitems being
typeset as a single paragraph. The package is responsive to the
index-related options and commands of the KOMA-Script and
memoir classes.

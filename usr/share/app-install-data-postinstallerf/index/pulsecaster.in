PulseCaster is a simple PulseAudio-based tool for making podcast
interviews. It is designed for ease of use and simplicity. The user
makes a call with a preferred PulseAudio-compatible Voice-over-IP
(VoIP) softphone application such as Ekiga or Twinkle, and then starts
PulseCaster to record the conversation to a multimedia file. The
resulting file can be published as a podcast or distributed in other
ways.

Indent is a GNU program for beautifying C code, so that it is easier to
read.  Indent can also convert from one C writing style to a different
one.  Indent understands correct C syntax and tries to handle incorrect
C syntax.

Install the indent package if you are developing applications in C and
you want a program to format your code.

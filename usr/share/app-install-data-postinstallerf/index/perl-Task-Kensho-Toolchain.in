Kensh? (??) (C. Wu) is a Japanese term for enlightenment
experiences?most commonly used within the confines of Zen
Buddhism?literally meaning "seeing ones nature"[1] or "true self."[2] It
generally "refers to the realization of non-duality of subject and
object."[3]

TaskKensho is a first cut at building a list of recommended modules for
Enlightened Perl development. CPAN is wonderful, but there are too many
wheels and you have to pick and choose among the various competing
technologies.

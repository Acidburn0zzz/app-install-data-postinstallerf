FIGlet prints its input using large characters (called "FIGcharacters") made
up of ordinary screen characters (called "sub-characters"). FIGlet output is
generally reminiscent of the sort of "signatures" many people like to put at
the end of e-mail and UseNet messages. It is also reminiscent of the output of
some banner programs, although it is oriented normally, not sideways.

Comment3='
The Zope Object Database provides an object-oriented database for Python
that provides a high-degree of transparency. Applications can take
advantage of object database features with few, if any, changes to
application logic. ZODB includes features such as a pluggable storage
interface, rich transaction support, and undo.

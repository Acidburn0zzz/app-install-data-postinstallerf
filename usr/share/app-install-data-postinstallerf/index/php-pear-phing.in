PHing Is Not GNU make; its a project build system based on Apache Ant.

You can do anything with it that you could do with a traditional build
system like GNU make, and its use of simple XML build files and extensible
PHP "task" classes make it an easy-to-use and highly flexible build
framework. Features include file transformations (e.g. token replacement,
XSLT transformation, Smarty template transformations), file system operations,
interactive build support, SQL execution, CVS operations, tools for creating
PEAR packages, and much more.

AMANDA, the Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver, is a
backup system that allows the administrator of a LAN to set up a
single master backup server to back up multiple hosts to one or more
tape drives or disk files.  AMANDA uses native dump and/or GNU tar
facilities and can back up a large number of workstations running
multiple versions of Unix.  Newer versions of AMANDA (including this
version) can use SAMBA to back up Microsoft(TM) Windows95/NT hosts.

be installed on both AMANDA clients and AMANDA servers.  Note that you
will have to install the amanda-client and/or amanda-server packages as

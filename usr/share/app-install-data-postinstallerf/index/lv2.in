LV2 is a standard for plugins and matching host applications, mainly
targeted at audio processing and generation.

There are a large number of open source and free software synthesis
packages in use or development at this time. This API (LV2) attempts
to give programmers the ability to write simple plugin audio
processors in C/C++ and link them dynamically (plug) into a range of
these packages (hosts).  It should be possible for any host and any
plugin to communicate completely through this interface.

The php-odbc package contains a dynamic shared object that will add
database support through ODBC to PHP. ODBC is an open specification
which provides a consistent API for developers to use for accessing
data sources (which are often, but not always, databases). PHP is an
HTML-embeddable scripting language. If you need ODBC support for PHP
applications, you will need to install this package and the php
package.

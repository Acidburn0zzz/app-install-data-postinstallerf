Exaile is a media player aiming to be similar to KDEs AmaroK, but for GTK+.
It incorporates many of the cool things from AmaroK (and other media players)
like automatic fetching of album art, handling of large libraries, lyrics
fetching, artist/album information via the wikipedia, last.fm support, optional
iPod support (assuming you have python-gpod installed).

In addition, Exaile also includes a built in shoutcast directory browser,
tabbed playlists (so you can have more than one playlist open at a time),
blacklisting of tracks (so they dont get scanned into your library),
downloading of guitar tablature from fretplay.com, and submitting played tracks

The tcp_wrappers package provides small daemon programs which can
monitor and filter incoming requests for systat, finger, FTP, telnet,
rlogin, rsh, exec, tftp, talk and other network services.

Install the tcp_wrappers program if you need a security tool for
filtering incoming network services requests.
This version also supports IPv6.

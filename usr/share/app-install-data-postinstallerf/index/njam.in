Njam is a fast-paced maze-game where you must eat all the cookies while
avoiding the badguys. Special cookies give you the power to freeze or eat the
bad guys. The game features single and multiplayer modes, network play,
duelling and cooperative games, great music and sound effects, customizable
level skins, many different levels and an integrated level editor.

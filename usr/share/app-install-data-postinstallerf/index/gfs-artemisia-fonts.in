Comment3='
The type family GFS Artemisia was designed by the painter-engraver Takis
Katsoulidis and reflects his style and typographic acumen. It is largely his
effort to offer, from a different perspective, a type face which, like Times
Greek, would be applicable to a wide spectrum of uses and equally agreeable and
legible.

The typeface has been digitised by George D. Matthiopoulos.

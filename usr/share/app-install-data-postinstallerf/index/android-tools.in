The Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is used to
- keep track of all Android devices and emulators instances
  connected to or running on a given host developer machine
- implement various control commands (e.g. "adb shell", "adb pull", etc.)
  for the benefit of clients (command-line users, or helper programs like
  DDMS). These commands are what is called a service in ADB.

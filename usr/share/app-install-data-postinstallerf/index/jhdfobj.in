HDF is a versatile data model that can represent very complex data objects
and a wide variety of meta-data. It is a completely portable file format
with no limit on the number or size of data objects in the collection.

This Java package implements HDF4/HDF5 data objects in an
object-oriented form. It provides a common Java API for accessing HDF files.

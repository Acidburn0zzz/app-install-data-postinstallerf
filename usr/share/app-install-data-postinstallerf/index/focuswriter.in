A fullscreen, distraction-free writing program. You can customize your
environment by changing the font, colors, and background image to add ambiance
as you type. FocusWriter features an on-the-fly updating word count, optional
auto-save, optional daily goals, and an interface that hides away to allow you
to focus more clearly; additionally, when you open the program your current
work-in-progress will automatically load and position you at the end of your
document, so that you can immediately jump back in.

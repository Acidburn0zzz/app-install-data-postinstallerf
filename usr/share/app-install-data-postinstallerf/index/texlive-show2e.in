Comment3='
This small package aims at making debugging (especially in an
interactive way) easier, by providing \show variants suited to
LaTeX2e commands (whether with optional arguments or robust)
and environments. The variant commands also display the
internal macros used by such commands, if any. The \showcs
variant helps with macros with exotic names.

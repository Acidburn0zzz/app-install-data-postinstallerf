JDOM is, quite simply, a Java representation of an XML document. JDOM
provides a way to represent that document for easy and efficient
reading, manipulation, and writing. It has a straightforward API, is a
lightweight and fast, and is optimized for the Java programmer. Its an
alternative to DOM and SAX, although it integrates well with both DOM
and SAX.

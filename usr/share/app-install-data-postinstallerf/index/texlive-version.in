Comment='<span size="xx-large">Conditionally include text</span>'
Comment3='
Defines macros \includeversion{NAME} and \excludeversion{NAME},
each of which defines an environment NAME whose text is to be
included or excluded from compilation. Although the command
syntax is very similar to that of comment, comment.sty is to be
preferred to version.sty for documents where significant chunks
of text may be excluded.

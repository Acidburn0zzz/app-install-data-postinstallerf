HexGlass is a Tetris-like puzzle game. Ten different types of blocks
continuously fall from above and you must arrange them to make horizontal
rows of hexagonal bricks. Completing any row causes those hexagonal blocks
to disappear and the rest above move downwards. The blocks above gradually
fall faster and the game is over when the screen fills up and blocks can
no longer fall from the top.

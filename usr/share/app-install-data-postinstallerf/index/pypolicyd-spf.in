Comment3='
pypolicyd-spf is a Postfix policy engine for Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
checking. It is implemented in pure Python and uses the python-spf (pyspf)
module.

This SPF policy server implementation provides flexible options for different
receiver policies and sender whitelisting to enable it to support a very wide
range of requirements.

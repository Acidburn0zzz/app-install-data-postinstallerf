Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications.

Twisted Names is both a domain name server as well as a client resolver
library. Twisted Names comes with an "out of the box" nameserver that can read
most BIND-syntax zone files as well as a simple Python-based configuration
format. Twisted Names can act as an authoritative server, perform zone
transfers from a master to act as a secondary, act as a caching nameserver, or
any combination of these. Twisted Names client resolver library provides
functions to query for all commonly-used record types as well as a replacement
for the blocking gethostbyname() function provided by the Python stdlib socket

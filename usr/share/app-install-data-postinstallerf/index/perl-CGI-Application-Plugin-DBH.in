Comment3='
CGIApplicationPluginDBH adds easy access to a DBI database handle to
your CGIApplication modules. Lazy loading is used to prevent a database
connection from being made if the dbh method is not called during the
request. In other words, the database connection is not created until it is
actually needed.

Comment3='
TLSSLed is a Linux shell script whose purpose is to evaluate the security of
a target SSL/TLS (HTTPS) web server implementation. It is based on sslscan, a
thorough SSL/TLS scanner that is based on the openssl library, and on the
"openssl s_client" command line tool. The current tests include checking if
the target supports the SSLv2 protocol, the NULL cipher, weak ciphers based
on their key length (40 or 56 bits), the availability of strong ciphers
(like AES), if the digital certificate is MD5 signed, and the current SSL/TLS
renegotiation capabilities.

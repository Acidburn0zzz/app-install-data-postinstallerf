Cycle is a calendar for women. Given a cycle length or statistics
for several periods, it can calculate the days until
menstruation, the days of "safe" sex, the fertile period, and the
days to ovulations, and define the d.o.b. of a child. It allows
the user to write notes and helps to supervise the administration
of hormonal contraceptive tablets.

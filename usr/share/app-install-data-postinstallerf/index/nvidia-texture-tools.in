The NVIDIA Texture Tools is a collection of image processing and texture
manipulation tools, designed to be integrated in game tools and asset
conditioning pipelines.

The primary features of the library are mipmap and normal map generation,
format conversion and DXT compression.
DXT compression is based on Simon Browns squish library. The library also
contains an alternative GPU-accelerated compressor that uses CUDA and is
one order of magnitude faster.

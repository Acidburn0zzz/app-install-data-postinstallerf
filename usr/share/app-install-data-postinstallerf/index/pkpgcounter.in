pkpgcounter parses files and outputs the number of pages needed to print them.
It can also, for certain file formats, compute the percentage of ink colors
covering each page. It currently recognizes almost 20 Page Description Languages
or file formats, including the most used ones like Postscript, PDF,
the PCL family, DVI, OpenDocument, or even Microsoft Word, corresponding to
hundreds of different printer drivers. This utility and Python library is often
used as the PDL parsing engine in print accounting software like PyKota or
JASMine, but can of course be used independently.

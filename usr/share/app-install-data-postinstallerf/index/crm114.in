Comment3='
CRM114 is a system to examine incoming e-mail, system log streams,
data files or other data streams, and to sort, filter, or alter the
incoming files or data streams according to the users wildest
desires. Criteria for categorization of data can be by satisfaction of
regexes, by sparse binary polynomial matching with a Bayesian Chain
Rule evaluator, or by other means.

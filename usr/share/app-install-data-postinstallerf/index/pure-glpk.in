This module provides a feature complete GLPK interface for the Pure
programming language, which lets you use all capabilities of the GNU Linear
Programming Kit (GLPK) directly from Pure.

GLPK contains an efficient simplex LP solver, a simplex LP solver in exact
arithmetics, an interior-point solver, a branch-and-cut solver for mixed
integer programming and some specialized algorithms for net/grid problems.
Using this interface you can build, modify and solve the problem, retrieve
the solution, load and save the problem and solution data in standard formats
and use any of advanced GLPK features.

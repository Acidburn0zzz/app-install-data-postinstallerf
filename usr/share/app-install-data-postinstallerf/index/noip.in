Keep your current IP address in sync with your No-IP host or domain with
this Dynamic Update Client (DUC). The client continually checks for IP
address changes in the background and automatically updates the DNS at
No-IP whenever it changes.

N.B. You need to run
	%# noip2 -C
before starting the service.

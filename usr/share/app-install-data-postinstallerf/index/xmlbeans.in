XMLBeans is a tool that allows you to access the full power
of XML in a Java friendly way. It is an XML-Java binding tool.
The idea is that you can take advantage the richness and
features of XML and XML Schema and have these features mapped
as naturally as possible to the equivalent Java language and
typing constructs. XMLBeans uses XML Schema to compile Java
interfaces and classes that you can then use to access and
modify XML instance data. Using XMLBeans is similar to using
any other Java interface/class, you will see things like
getFoo or setFoo just as you would expect when working with

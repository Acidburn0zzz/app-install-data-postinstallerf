Comment3='
Implements the data type "matrix of reals" (and consequently also
"vector of reals") which can be used almost like any other basic
Perl type thanks to OPERATOR OVERLOADING, i.e.,

    $A = $matrix1 * $matrix2;
    $B = $A ** 2;
    $C = $A + 2*B;
    $D = $C - $B/2;
    $inverse = $C ** -1;
    $inverse = 1/$C;

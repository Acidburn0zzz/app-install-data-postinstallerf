Tango is a cohesive and comprehensive library for the D programming language,
including a complete D runtime along with a tiered set of application services
and utilities.
Tango tries hard to provide a platform agnostic API where it makes sense, and
avoid too many application specific features.
Tango is a cross-platform open-source software library, written in the D
programming language for D programmers.
Availability of solid and extensive documentation represents a prime factor in
library accessibility, and thus this project is as much about documentation
production as it is about top-notch functionality.

Beacon is an XSLT based plug-able WYSIWYG editor for DocBook xml. It
is intended to serve as an easy to use tool which will attract new
contributors who would otherwise be discouraged by the steep learning
curve involved with DocBook and will also provide a convenient
alternative to those who are old-timers. More information is available
at https//fedoraproject.org/wiki/DocBook_Editor_Documentation and

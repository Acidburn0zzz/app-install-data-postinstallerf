GProject is an extension of Geanys project management displaying a tree of
files belonging to the project in the sidebar. In addition, it enables quick
swapping between header and source files, searching project files by name
and more. The plugin was created with big projects in mind so everything
works fast enough even with projects consisting of hundreds of thousands of
files.

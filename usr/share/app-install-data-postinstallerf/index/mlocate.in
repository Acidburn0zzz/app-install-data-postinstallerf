mlocate is a locate/updatedb implementation.  It keeps a database of
all existing files and allows you to lookup files by name.

The m stands for "merging" updatedb reuses the existing database to avoid
rereading most of the file system, which makes updatedb faster and does not
trash the system caches as much as traditional locate implementations.

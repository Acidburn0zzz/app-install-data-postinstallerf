epgd is part of the double team epgd+epg2vdr to effectively retrieve,
store and import epg data to vdr. It is designed to handle large amount of
data and pictures in a distributed environment with one epg-server and
many possible vdr-clients - therefore it relays on mysql.

Though it is possible to use epgd alone with mysql it only makes sense to
use it as backend to the vdr-plugin epg2vdr. That being said you need to
install, setup and configure mysql, epgd and epg2vdr in order to get a
working environment.

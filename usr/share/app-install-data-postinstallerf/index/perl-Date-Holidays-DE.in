Comment3='
A perl module that creates a list of German holidays in a given year.
It knows about special holiday regulations for all of Germanys federal
states and also about "semi-holidays" and religious "silent days" that
will be treated as holidays on request. Holidays that occur on weekends
can be excluded from the generated list. The generated list can also be
freely formatted using regular strftime() format definitions.

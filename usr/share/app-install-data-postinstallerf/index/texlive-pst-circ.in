Comment3='
The package is built using PSTricks and in particular pst-node.
It can easily draw current 2-terminal devices and some 3- and
4-terminal devices used in electronic or electric theory. The
packages macros are designed with a view to logical
representation of circuits, as far as possible, so as to
relieve the user of purely graphical considerations when
expressing a circuit.

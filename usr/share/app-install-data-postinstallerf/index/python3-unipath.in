Comment3='
Unipath is a package for doing pathname calculations and filesystem
access in an object-oriented manner, an alternative to functions in
os.path, shutil and glob, and even some functions in os.* Its based
on Jason Orendorffs path.py but does not adhere as strictly to the
underlying functions syntax, in order to provide more user
convenience and higher-level functionality. For example

 o p.mkdir() succeeds silently if the directory already exists, and
 o p.mkdir(True) creates intermediate directories a la os.makedirs.
 o p.rmtree(parents=True) combines shutil.rmtree, os.path.isdir,

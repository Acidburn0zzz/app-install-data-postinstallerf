Comment3='
Session management system for JACK applications on GNU/Linux. Its aim
is to have many different audio programs running at once, to save their
setup, close them down and then easily reload the setup at some other
time. ladish doesnt deal with any kind of audio or MIDI data itself;
it just runs programs, deals with saving/loading (arbitrary) data and
connects JACK ports together.
Ladish has a GUI frontend called gladish, based on lpatchage (LADI Patchage)
and the ladish_control command line app for headless operation.

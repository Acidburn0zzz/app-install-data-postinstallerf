This package provides the console with the same keyboard configuration
scheme that X Window System has. Besides the keyboard, the package configures
also the font on the console.  It includes a rich collection of fonts and
supports several languages that would be otherwise unsupported on the console
(such as Armenian, Georgian, Lao and Thai).

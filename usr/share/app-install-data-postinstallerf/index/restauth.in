Comment3='
Lightweight web-service that provides shared authentication, authorization
and preferences. RestAuth does not attempt to provide "one account
for the web" like OpenId or OAuth but instead allows multiple systems
to directly use the same user base, much like the way LDAP or Kerberos is
commonly used.

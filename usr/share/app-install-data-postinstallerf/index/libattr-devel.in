This package contains header files and documentation needed to
develop programs which make use of extended attributes.
For Linux programs, the documented system call API is the
recommended interface, but an SGI IRIX compatibility interface
is also provided.

Currently only ext2, ext3 and XFS support extended attributes.
The SGI IRIX compatibility API built above the Linux system calls is
used by programs such as xfsdump(8), xfsrestore(8) and xfs_fsr(8).

Comment3='
DBIAgent is your answer to non-blocking DBI in POE.

DBIAgent forks off a configurable number of helper processes for
running DBI queries.  The states that depend on the output of the
queries only get called when there is data for them to process.  No
more agonizing about query optimization in terms of milliseconds
because the rest of your program will suffer.  Leave that to the
operating system!  POE is designed for doing a lot of things
concurrently.  Waiting isnt doing, its waiting... -)

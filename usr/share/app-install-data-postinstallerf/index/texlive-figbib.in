FigBib lets you organize your figures in BibTeX databases. Some
FigBib features are - Store and manage figures in a BibTeX
database; - Include figures in your LaTeX document with one
short command; - Generate a List of Figures containing
more/other information than the figure captions; - Control with
one switch where to output the figures, either as usual float
objects or in a separate part at the end of your document.

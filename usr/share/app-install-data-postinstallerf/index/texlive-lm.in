The Latin Modern family of fonts consists of 72 text fonts and
20 mathematics fonts, and is based on the Computer Modern fonts
released into public domain by AMS (copyright (c) 1997 AMS).
The lm font set contains a lot of additional characters, mainly
accented ones, but not exclusively. There is one set of fonts,
available both in Adobe Type 1 format (*.pfb) and in OpenType
format (*.otf). There are five sets of TeX Font Metric files,
corresponding to Cork encoding (cork-*.tfm); QX encoding (qx-
*.tfm); TeXnANSI aka LY1 encoding (texnansi-*.tfm); T5
(Vietnamese) encoding (t5-*.tfm); and Text Companion for EC

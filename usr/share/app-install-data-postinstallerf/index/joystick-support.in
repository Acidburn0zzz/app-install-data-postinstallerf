By default the joystick and game pad drivers are not loaded at boot time. Nor
are they installed by default. Installing this package will load the main
joystick and game pad drivers as part of the install, will bring in
kernel-modules-extra if it isnt already, and will set things so that they
will be loaded during future boots.

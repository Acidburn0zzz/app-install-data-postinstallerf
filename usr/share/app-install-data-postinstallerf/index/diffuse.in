Diffuse is a graphical tool for merging and comparing text files. Diffuse is
able to compare an arbitrary number of files side-by-side and gives users the
ability to manually adjust line-matching and directly edit files. Diffuse can
also retrieve revisions of files from Bazaar, CVS, Darcs, Git, Mercurial,
Monotone, RCS, Subversion, and SVK repositories for comparison and merging.

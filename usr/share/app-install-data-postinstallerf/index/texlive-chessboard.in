This package offers commands to print chessboards. It can print
partial boards, hide pieces and fields, color the boards and
put various marks on the board. It has a lot of options to
place pieces on the board. Using exotic pieces (e.g., for fairy
chess) is possible. The documentation includes an example of an
animated chessboard, for those whose PDF viewer can display
animations.

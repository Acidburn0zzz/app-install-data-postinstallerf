Mingzat is based on Jason Glavys JG Lepcha font which was a custom-encoded
font. The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font
that would contain all Lepcha characters. In addition, there is provision for
other Latin characters and symbols. This font makes use of state-of-the-art
font technologies (Graphite and OpenType) to support the need for conjuncts
and to position arbitrary combinations of Lepcha glyphs and combining marks
optimally.

PLY is a straightforward lex/yacc implementation. Here is a list of its
essential features
* It is implemented entirely in Python.
* It uses LR-parsing which is reasonably efficient and well suited for larger
  grammars.
* PLY provides most of the standard lex/yacc features including support
  for empty productions, precedence rules, error recovery, and support
  for ambiguous grammars.
* PLY is straightforward to use and provides very extensive error checking.
* PLY doesnt try to do anything more or less than provide the basic lex/yacc

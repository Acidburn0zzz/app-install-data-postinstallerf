The Audio File library is an implementation of the Audio File Library
from SGI, which provides an API for accessing audio file formats like
AIFF/AIFF-C, WAVE, and NeXT/Sun .snd/.au files. This library is used
by the EsounD daemon.

Install audiofile if you are installing EsounD or you need an API for
any of the sound file formats it can handle.

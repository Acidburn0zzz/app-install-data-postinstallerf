Berusky 2 is a game that challenges your visual/spatial thinking
and ability to find a way to resolve a logic task. Using five bugs,
youll go through an adventure full of various puzzles spread across
nine episodes. Individual episodes differ in appearance and difficulty,
which increases throughout the game.

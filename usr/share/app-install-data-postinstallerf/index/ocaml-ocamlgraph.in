Ocamlgraph provides several different implementations of graph data
structures. It also provides implementations for a number of classical
graph algorithms like Kruskals algorithm for MSTs, topological
ordering of DAGs, Dijkstras shortest paths algorithm, and
Ford-Fulkersons maximal-flow algorithm to name a few. The algorithms
and data structures are written functorially for maximal
reusability. Also has input and output capability for Graph Modeling
Language file format and Dot and Neato graphviz (graph visualization)
tools.

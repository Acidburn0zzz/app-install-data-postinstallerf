LatencyTOP is a tool for software developers (both kernel and userspace), aimed
at identifying where in the system latency is happening, and what kind of
operation/action is causing the latency to happen so that the code can be
changed to avoid the worst latency hiccups.
This package contains files needed by both the GUI and TUI builds of LatencyTOP.

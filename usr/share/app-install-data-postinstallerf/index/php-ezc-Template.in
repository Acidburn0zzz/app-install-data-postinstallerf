The template component provides a manageable way to separate application logic
from presentation data. The application logic is the PHP code of your
application, including the call to the Template component. Presentation data
are the template files.

The separation of application logic and presentation data is easier to maintain
and allows different people to work on separate parts. Another advantage is
that the Template language is more suitable for non programmers and web
designers. The language is designed to be easier to use and contains
more expressive constructs for repetitive tasks in the presentation data.

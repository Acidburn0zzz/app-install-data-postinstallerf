Comment3='
The package allows LaTeX users to typeset MetaPost code inline
and display figures in their documents with only and only one
run of LaTeX, PDFLaTeX or XelaTeX (no separate runs of mpost).
Mpgraphics achieves this by using the shell escape (\write 18)
feature of current TeX distributions, so that the whole process
is automatic and the end user is saved the tiresome processing.

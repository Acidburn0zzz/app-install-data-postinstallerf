netGo is a distribution-independent networking tool (written in Qt) for
changing network settings quickly and easily. It is intended for laptop
owners, who often need to change network settings when relocating.
It allows you to create profiles that contain the network settings such as the
IP, netmask, gateway, name servers and wireless options. After creating a
profile it can be executed with a single click.

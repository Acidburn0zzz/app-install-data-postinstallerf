Comment3='
Transforms Wiki and BBCode markup into XHTML, LaTeX or plain text markup.
This is the base engine for all of the Text_Wiki sub-classes

The text transformation is done in 2 steps.
The chosen parser uses markup rules to tokenize the tags and content.
Renderers output the tokens and text into the requested format.
The tokenized form replaces the tags by a protected byte value associated
to an index in an options table. This form shares up to 50 rules by all
parsers and renderers.

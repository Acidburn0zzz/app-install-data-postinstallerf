libAfterImage   is a generic image manipulation library. It was initially
implemented to address AfterStep Window Managers needs for image handling,
but it evolved into extremely powerful and flexible software, suitable for
virtually any project that has needs for loading, manipulating, displaying
images, as well as writing images in files. Most of the popular image formats
are supported using standard libraries, with XCF, XPM, PPM/PNM, BMP, ICO,
TGA and GIF being supported internally.

PNG, JPEG and TIFF formats are supported via standard libraries.

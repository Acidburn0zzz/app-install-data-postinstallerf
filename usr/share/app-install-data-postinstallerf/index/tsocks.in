Comment3='
tsocks is designed for use in machines which are firewalled from the
Internet. It avoids the need to recompile applications like lynx or
telnet so they can use SOCKS to reach the Internet. It behaves much
like the SOCKSified TCP/IP stacks seen on other platforms.

tsocks is a library to allow transparent SOCKS proxying. It wraps the
normal connect() function. When a connection is attempted, it consults
the configuration file (which is defined at configure time but defaults
to /etc/tsocks.conf) and determines if the IP address specified is local.
If it is not, the library redirects the connection to a SOCKS server

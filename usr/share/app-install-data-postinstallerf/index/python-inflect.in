The methods of the class engine in module inflect.py provide plural
inflections, singular noun inflections, "a"/"an" selection for English words,
and manipulation of numbers as words.

Plural forms of all nouns, most verbs, and some adjectives are provided. Where
appropriate, "classical" variants (for example "brother" -> "brethren",
"dogma" -> "dogmata", etc.) are also provided.
Single forms of nouns are also provided. The gender of singular pronouns can be
chosen (for example "they" -> "it" or "she" or "he" or "they").

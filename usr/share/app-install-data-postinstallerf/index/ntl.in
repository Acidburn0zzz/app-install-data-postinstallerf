NTL is a high-performance, portable C++ library providing data structures
and algorithms for arbitrary length integers; for vectors, matrices, and
polynomials over the integers and over finite fields; and for arbitrary
precision floating point arithmetic.

NTL provides high quality implementations of state-of-the-art algorithms for
* arbitrary length integer arithmetic and arbitrary precision floating point
  arithmetic;
* polynomial arithmetic over the integers and finite fields including basic
  arithmetic, polynomial factorization, irreducibility testing, computation

The YTalk program is essentially a chat program for multiple users.
YTalk works just like the UNIX talk program and even communicates with
the same talk daemon(s), but YTalk allows for multiple connections
(unlike UNIX talk).  YTalk also supports redirection of program output
to other users as well as an easy-to-use menu of commands.

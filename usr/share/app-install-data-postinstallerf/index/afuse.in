Afuse is an automounting file system implemented in user-space using FUSE.
Afuse currently implements the most basic functionality that can be expected
by an automounter; that is it manages a directory of virtual directories. If
one of these virtual directories is accessed and is not already automounted,
afuse will attempt to mount a filesystem onto that directory. If the mount
succeeds the requested access proceeds as normal, otherwise it will fail
with an error.

A Wiki is a website that allows its users to add pages, and edit any
existing pages. It is one of the most popular forms of web collaboration.
If you are new to wiki, visit http//c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors
which is possibly the oldest wiki, and has lots of information about how
wikis work.

Kwiki is a Perl wiki implementation based on the Spoon application
architecture and using the Spiffy object orientation model. The major goals
of Kwiki are that it be easy to install, maintain and extend.

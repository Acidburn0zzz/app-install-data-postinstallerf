GeoIP is a C library that enables the user to find the country that any IP
address or hostname originates from.

It uses file based databases that can optionally be updated on a weekly basis
by installing the GeoIP-update (IPv4) and/or GeoIP-update6 (IPv6) packages.
This package includes GeoLite data created by MaxMind, available from

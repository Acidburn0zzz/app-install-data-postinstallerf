Blackbox is a window manager for the X Window environment, which is
almost completely compliant with ICCCM specified operation policies.
It features nice and fast interface with multiple workspaces and
simple menus. Fast built-in graphics code that can render solids,
gradients and bevels is used to draw window decorations. Remaining
small in size, blackbox preserves memory and CPU.

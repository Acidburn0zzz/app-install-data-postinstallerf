This module is meant to eventually offer generic support for premise
routers when used by providers to offer sip/voip service to a subscriber.
It offers rtp proxying and routing based on the assumption that all calls
will be handed off to an external voip provider and automatic rtp
proxy bridging between a subscribers local subnet and an isp.  In theory
this would be deployed in an isp supplied premise router to enable a
local user to subscribe a series of local softphone/sip devices with a
remote voip service provider.

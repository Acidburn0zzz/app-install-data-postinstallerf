Comment3='
Ingo, the "Email Filter Rules Manager", started as a frontend for the Sieve
filter language, and is now a generic and complete filter rule frontend that
currently is able to create Sieve, procmail, and IMAP filter rules. The IMAP
filter driver translates the filter rules on demand to IMAP commands, executed
via PHPs IMAP extension and has replaced IMPs internal filtering code. It is
now the default filtering agent in IMP H3 (4.0).

The Horde Project writes web applications in PHP and releases them under
Open Source licenses.  For more information (including help with ingo)

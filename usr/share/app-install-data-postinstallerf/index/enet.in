ENet is a relatively thin, simple and robust network communication layer on
top of UDP (User Datagram Protocol). The primary feature it provides is
optional reliable, in-order delivery of packets.

ENet is NOT intended to be a general purpose high level networking library
that handles authentication, lobbying, server discovery, compression,
encryption and other high level, often application level or dependent tasks.

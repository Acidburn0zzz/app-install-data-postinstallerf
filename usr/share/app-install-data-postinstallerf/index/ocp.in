Comment3='
Open Cubic Player is a music file player ported from DOS that supports
Amiga MOD module formats and many variants, such as MTM, STM, 669,
S3M, XM, and IT.  It is also able to render MIDI files using sound
patches and play SID, OGG Vorbis, FLAC, and WAV files.  OCP provides a
nice text-based interface with several text-based and graphical
visualizations.

This package allows the user to create an index of all authors
cited in a LaTeX document. Each author entry in the index
contains the pages where these citations occur. Alternatively,
the package can list the labels of the citations that appear in
the references rather than the text pages. The package relies
on BibTeX being used to handle citations. Additionally, it
requires Perl (version 5 or higher).

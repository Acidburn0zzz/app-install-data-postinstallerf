Comment3='
The package provides an environment, tabu, which will make any
sort of tabular (that doesnt need to split across pages), and
an environment longtabu which provides the facilities of tabu
in a modified longtable environment. (Note that this latter
offers an enhancement of ltxtable.) The package requires the
array package, and needs e-TeX to run (since array.sty is
present in every conforming distribution of LaTeX, and since
every publicly available LaTeX format is built using e-TeX, the
requirements are provided by default on any reasonable system).
The package also requires xcolor for coloured rules in tables,

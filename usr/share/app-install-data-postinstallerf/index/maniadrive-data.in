Data files for maniadrive, a 3D stunt driving game. Notice this package does
not include the original ManiaDrive soundtrack as the original soundtrack is
licensed under a CC BY-NC-SA license, which is not acceptable to Fedora.

A replacement soundtrack is available in the maniadrive-music package (and will
get automatically installed together with maniadrive itself).

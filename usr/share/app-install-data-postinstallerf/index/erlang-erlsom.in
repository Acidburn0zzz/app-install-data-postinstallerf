Comment3='
Erlsom is a set of functions to deal with XML Schema (XSDs) in Erlang.
First you compile the schema, and after that you can parse XML
documents that conform to the schema. The result is a structure of
Erlang records, based on the types that are defined by the Schema.
Or, the other way around, a structure of records can be translated
to an XML document.

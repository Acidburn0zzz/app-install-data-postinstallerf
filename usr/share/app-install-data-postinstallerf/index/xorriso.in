Comment3='
Xorriso is a program which copies file objects from POSIX compliant
filesystems into Rock Ridge enhanced ISO-9660 filesystems and allows
session-wise manipulation of such filesystems. It can load management
information of existing ISO images and it writes the session results
to optical media or to filesystem objects. Vice versa xorriso is able
to copy file objects out of ISO-9660 filesystems.

Filesystem manipulation capabilities surpass those of mkisofs. Xorriso
is especially suitable for backups, because of its high fidelity of
file attribute recording and its incremental update sessions. Optical

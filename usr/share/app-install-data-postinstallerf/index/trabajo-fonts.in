Comment='<span size="xx-large">Latin Serif font that supports Shavian alphabet</span>'
Comment3='
Designed for use with the Shavian alphabet, a phonemic spelling reform proposal
for English, but also supports extended Latin, and basic Cyrillic. "Trabajo"
(pronounced [t?a??axo] if youre Spanish or [t???b??ho?] if youre English)
is Spanish for "I work". Trabajo has become a Serif font as of version 2.0,
for improved appearance.

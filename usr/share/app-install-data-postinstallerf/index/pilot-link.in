This suite of tools allows you to upload and download programs and
data files between a Linux/UNIX machine and the PalmPilot. It has a
few extra utilities that will allow for things like syncing the
PalmPilots calendar app with Ical. Note that you might still need to
consult the sources for pilot-link if you would like the Python, Tcl,
or Perl bindings.

Install pilot-link if you want to synchronize your Palm with your Red
Hat Linux system.

Comment3='
The Docutils project specifies a plaintext markup language, reStructuredText,
which is easy to read and quick to write.  The project includes a python
library to parse rST files and transform them into other useful formats such
as HTML, XML, and TeX as well as commandline tools that give the enduser
access to this functionality.

Currently, the library supports parsing rST that is in standalone files and
PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals).  Work is underway to parse rST from
Python inline documentation modules and packages.

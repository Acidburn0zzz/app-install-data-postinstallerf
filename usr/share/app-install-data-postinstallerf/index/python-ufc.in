UFC (Unified Form-assembly Code) is a unified framework for finite
element assembly. More precisely, it defines a fixed interface for
communicating low level routines (functions) for evaluating and
assembling finite element variational forms. The UFC interface
consists of a single header file ufc.h that specifies a C++ interface
that must be implemented by code that complies with the UFC
specification.

TextUnidecode provides a function, `unidecode(...) that
takes Unicode data and tries to represent it in US-ASCII
characters (i.e., the universally displayable characters between
0x00 and 0x7F). The representation is almost always an attempt at
pronunciation expressed by the text in some other writing
system.

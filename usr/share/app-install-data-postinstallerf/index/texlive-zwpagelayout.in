This package was developed as a typographers toolbox offering
important basic features for everyday work. It allows setting
the paper size and the page layout; it can print crop marks;
and it can reflect pages both horizontally and vertically. The
package facilities work with TeX + dvips or (x)dvipdfm(x), and
with pdfTeX.

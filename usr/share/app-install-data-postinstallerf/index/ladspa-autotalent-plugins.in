Autotalent is a real-time pitch correction plugin. You specify the notes that
a singer is allowed to hit, and Autotalent makes sure that they do. You can
also use Autotalent for more exotic effects, making your voice sound like a
chiptune, adding artificial vibrato, or messing with your formants.
Autotalent can also be used as a harmonizer that knows how to sing in the
scale with you. Or, you can use Autotalent to change the scale of a melody
between major and minor or to change the musical mode.

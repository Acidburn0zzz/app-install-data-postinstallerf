GNUs Autoconf is a tool for configuring source code and Makefiles.
Using Autoconf, programmers can create portable and configurable
packages, since the person building the package is allowed to specify
various configuration options.

You should install Autoconf if you are developing software and you
would like to use it to create shell scripts that will configure your
source code packages. If you are installing Autoconf, you will also
need to install the GNU m4 package.

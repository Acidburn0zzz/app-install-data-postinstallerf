Comment3='
Cpphs is a re-implementation of the C pre-processor that is both
more compatible with Haskell, and itself written in Haskell so
that it can be distributed with compilers.

This version of the C pre-processor is pretty-much
feature-complete and compatible with traditional (K&R)
pre-processors.  Additional features include a plain-text mode;
an option to unlit literate code files; and an option to turn
off macro-expansion.

S3QL is a file system that stores all its data online using storage services
like Google Storage, Amazon S3 or OpenStack. S3QL effectively provides a hard
disk of dynamic, infinite capacity that can be accessed from any computer
with Internet access.

S3QL is a standard conforming, full featured UNIX file system that is
conceptually indistinguishable from any local file system. Furthermore, S3QL
has additional features like compression, encryption, data de-duplication,
immutable trees and snapshotting which make it especially suitable for on-line
backup and archival.

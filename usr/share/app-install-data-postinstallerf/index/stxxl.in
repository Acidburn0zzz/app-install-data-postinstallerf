Comment3='
stxxl provides an STL replacement using an abstraction layer to
storage devices to allow for the optimal layout of data structures. This
allows for multi-terabyte data sets to be held and manipulated in standard
C++ data structures, whilst abstracting the complexity of managing this
behavior efficiently. stxxl utilises multi-disk I/O to speed up
I/O bound calculations. STXXL has been developed at the University
of Karlsruhe.

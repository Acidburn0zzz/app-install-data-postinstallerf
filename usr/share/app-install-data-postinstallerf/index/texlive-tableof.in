The package provides the commands to flag chapters or sections
(or anything else destined to become a TOC line). The command
\nexttocwithtags{req1,req2,...}{excl1,excl2,...} specifies
which tags are to be required and which ones are to be excluded
by the next \tableofcontents (or equivalent) command. In a
document that uses a class where \tableofcontents may only be
used once, the command
\tableoftaggedcontents{req1,req2,...}{excl1,excl2,...} may be
used to provide several tables.

XULRunner is a Mozilla runtime package that can be used to bootstrap XUL+XPCOM
applications that are as rich as Firefox and Thunderbird. It provides mechanisms
for installing, upgrading, and uninstalling these applications. XULRunner also
provides libxul, a solution which allows the embedding of Mozilla technologies
in other projects and products.

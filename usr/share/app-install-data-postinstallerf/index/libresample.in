A real-time library for audio sampling rate conversion providing
several useful features relative to resample-1.7 on which it is based

    * It should build "out of the box" on more platforms, including
      Linux, Solaris, and Mac OS X (using the included configure
      script). There is also a Visual C++ project file for building
      under Windows.
    * Input and output signals are in memory (as opposed to sound
      files).

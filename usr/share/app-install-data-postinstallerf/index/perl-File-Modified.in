The Modified module is intended as a simple method for programs to detect
whether configuration files (or modules they rely on) have changed. There
are currently two methods of change detection implemented, mtime and MD5.
The MD5 method will fall back to use timestamps if the DigestMD5 module
cannot be loaded.

Sample applications to demonstrate the usage of various TrueZIP module
APIs.

Some of these samples use rather advanced or exotic features which
makes them more complex than necessary for a typical application.
By design, the sample applications use all file system drivers which
can be located at runtime.
Location of the available file system drivers is performed by
scanning the class path - see the Javaodoc for the TrueZIP Kernel class

SysSigAction provides EASY access to POSIXsigaction() for signal
handling on systems that support sigaction().
It is hoped that with the use of this module, your signal handling
behavior can be coded in a way that does not change from one perl
version to the next, and that sigaction() will be easier for you to use.

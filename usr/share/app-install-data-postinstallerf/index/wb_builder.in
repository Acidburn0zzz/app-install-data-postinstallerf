This package includes a HDL generator from a text description or via
GUI input for the Wishbone Bus.

The Wishbone Bus is an open source hardware computer bus intended
to let the parts of an integrated circuit communicate with each other.
The aim is to allow the connection of differing cores to each other
inside of a chip. The Wishbone Bus is used by many designs in the
OpenCores project.

Halibut is yet another text formatting system, intended primarily for
writing software documentation. It accepts a single source format and
outputs a variety of formats, planned to include text, HTML, Texinfo,
Windows Help, Windows HTMLHelp, PostScript and PDF. It has comprehensive
indexing and cross-referencing support, and generates hyperlinks within
output documents wherever possible.

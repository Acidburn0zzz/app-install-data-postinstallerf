Finally a networked multiplayer game in the vein of the puzzle classic Bust a
Move/Puzzle Bobble. Beat your friends in this addictive game, or play against
a random opponent! The purpose of this game is to shoot colored orbs into your
playfield, so they form groups of three or more. You win if you manage to
remove all orbs. You lose if any orb attaches below the white line.

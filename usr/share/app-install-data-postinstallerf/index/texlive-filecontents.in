LaTeX2es filecontents and filecontents* environments enable a
LaTeX source file to generate external files as it runs through
LaTeX. However, there are two limitations of these
environments they refuse to overwrite existing files, and they
can only be used in the preamble of a document. The
filecontents package removes these limitations, letting you
overwrite existing files and letting you use
filecontents/filecontents* anywhere.

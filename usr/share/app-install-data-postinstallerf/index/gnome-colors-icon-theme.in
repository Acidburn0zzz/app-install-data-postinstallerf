The GNOME-Colors is a project that aims to make the GNOME desktop as
elegant, consistent and colorful as possible.

The current goal is to allow full color customization of themes, icons,
GDM logins and splash screens. There are already seven full color-schemes
available; Brave (Blue), Human (Orange), Wine (Red), Noble (Purple), Wise
(Green), Dust (Chocolate) and Illustrious (Pink). An unlimited amount of
color variations can be rebuilt and recolored from source, so users need
not stick to the officially supported color palettes.

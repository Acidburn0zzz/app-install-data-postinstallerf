Comment3='
This module provides bare bones try/catch statements that are designed to
minimize common mistakes with eval blocks, and NOTHING else.

This is unlike TryCatch, which provides a nice syntax and avoids adding
another call stack layer, and supports calling return from the try block to
return from the parent subroutine. These extra features come at a cost of a
few dependencies, namely DevelDeclare and ScopeUpper that are occasionally
problematic, and the additional catch filtering uses Moose type constraints,
which may not be desirable either.

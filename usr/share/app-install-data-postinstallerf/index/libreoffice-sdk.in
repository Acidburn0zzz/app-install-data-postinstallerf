The LibreOffice SDK is an add-on for the LibreOffice office suite. It provides
the necessary tools for programming using the LibreOffice APIs and for creating
extensions (UNO components) for LibreOffice.  To set the build environment for
building against the sdk use /usr/lib64/libreoffice/sdk/setsdkenv_unix.sh.

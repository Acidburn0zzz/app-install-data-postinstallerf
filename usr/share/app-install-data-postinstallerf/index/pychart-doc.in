PyChart is a Python library for creating high quality Encapsulated Postscript,
PDF, PNG, or SVG charts. It currently supports line plots, bar plots,
range-fill plots, and pie charts. Because it is based on Python, you can make
full use of Pythons scripting power.

Install this package if you want the developers documentation and examples
that tell you how to program with the pychart library.

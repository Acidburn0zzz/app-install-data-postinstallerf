The ipmiutil package provides easy-to-use utilities to view the SEL,
perform an IPMI chassis reset, set up the IPMI LAN and Platform Event Filter
entries to allow SNMP alerts, Serial-Over-LAN console, event daemon, and
other IPMI tasks.
These can be invoked with the metacommand ipmiutil, or via subcommand
shortcuts as well.  IPMIUTIL can also write sensor thresholds, FRU asset tags,
and has a full IPMI configuration save/restore.
An IPMI driver can be provided by either the OpenIPMI driver (/dev/ipmi0)
or the Intel IPMI driver (/dev/imb), etc.  If used locally and no driver is
detected, ipmiutil will use user-space direct I/Os instead.

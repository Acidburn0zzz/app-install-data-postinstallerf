This is a complete interactive high-precision arithmetic computing
environment.  One enters expressions in a Mathematica-style syntax,
and the operations are performed using the ARPREC package, with a
level of precision that can be set from 100 to 1000 decimal digit
accuracy.  Variables and vector arrays can be defined and referenced.
This program supports all basic arithmetic operations, common
transcendental and combinatorial functions, multi-pair PSLQ (one-,
two- or three-level versions), high-precision quadrature, i.e. numeric
integration (Gaussian, error function or tanh-sinh), and summation of
series.

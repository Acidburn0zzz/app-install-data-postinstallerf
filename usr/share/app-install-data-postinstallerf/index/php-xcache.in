Comment3='
XCache is a fast, stable  PHP opcode and data cacher that has been tested
and is now running on production servers under high load.

It is tested (on linux) and supported on all of the latest PHP release.
ThreadSafe is also perfectly supported.
NOTICE opcode cacher is disable to allow use with php-opcache only for user
data cache. You need to edit configuration file (xcache.ini) to enable it.

Comment3='
An instance of this class represents a timezone that was specified by means
of a System V timezone recipe or the POSIX extended form of the same
syntax. These can express a plain offset from Universal Time, or a system
of two offsets (standard and daylight saving time) switching on a yearly
cycle according to certain types of rule.

This class implements the DateTimeTimeZone interface, so that its instances
can be used with DateTime objects.

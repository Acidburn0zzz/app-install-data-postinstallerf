LocaleMaketextGettext joins the GNU gettext and Maketext frameworks. It
is a subclass of LocaleMaketext(3) that follows the way GNU gettext
works. It works seamlessly, both in the sense of GNU gettext and Maketext.
As a result, you enjoy both their advantages, and get rid of both their
problems, too.

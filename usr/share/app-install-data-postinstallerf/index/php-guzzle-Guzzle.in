Guzzle takes the pain out of sending HTTP requests and the redundancy out
of creating web service clients.

Guzzle is a framework that includes the tools needed to create a robust web
service client, including Service descriptions for defining the inputs and
outputs of an API, resource iterators for traversing paginated resources,
batching for sending a large number of requests as efficiently as possible.

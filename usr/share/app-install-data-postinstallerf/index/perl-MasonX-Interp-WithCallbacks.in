Comment3='
MasonXInterpWithCallbacks subclasses HTMLMasonInterp in order to
provide a Mason callback system built on ParamsCallbackRequest. Callbacks
may be either code references provided to the new() constructor, or methods
defined in subclasses of ParamsCallback. Callbacks are triggered either
for every request or by specially named keys in the Mason request
arguments, and all callbacks are executed at the beginning of a request,
just before Mason creates and executes the request component stack.

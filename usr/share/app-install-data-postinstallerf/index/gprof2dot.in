Comment3='
This is a Python script to convert the output from prof, gprof, oprofile,
Shark, AQtime, and python profilers into a dot graph.  It has the following
features

* can correctly parse C++ template function names
* allows to prune nodes and edges below a certain threshold
* uses an heuristic to propagate time inside mutually recursive functions
* uses color efficiently to draw attention to hot-spots

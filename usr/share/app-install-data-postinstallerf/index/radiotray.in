Radio Tray is an online radio streaming player that runs on a Linux system
tray. Its goal is to have the minimum interface possible, making it very
straightforward to use. Radio Tray is not a full featured music player,
there are plenty of excellent music players already. However, there was a
need for a simple application with minimal interface just to listen to online
radios. And thats the sole purpose of Radio Tray.

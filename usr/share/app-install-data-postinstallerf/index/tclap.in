tclap is a small, flexible library that provides a simple interface for
defining and accessing command line arguments. It was initially inspired by
the user friendly CLAP library. The difference is that this library is
template-only, so the argument class is type independent. Type independence
avoids identical-except-for-type objects, such as IntArg, FloatArg, and
StringArg. While the library is not strictly compliant with the GNU or
POSIX standards, it is close.

tclap is written in ANSI C++ and is meant to be compatible with any
standards-compliant C++ compiler. The library is implemented entirely

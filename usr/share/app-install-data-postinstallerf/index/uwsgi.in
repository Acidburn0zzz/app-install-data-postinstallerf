Comment3='
uWSGI is a fast (pure C), self-healing, developer/sysadmin-friendly
application container server.  Born as a WSGI-only server, over time it has
evolved in a complete stack for networked/clustered web applications,
implementing message/object passing, caching, RPC and process management.
It uses the uwsgi (all lowercase, already included by default in the Nginx
and Cherokee releases) protocol for all the networking/interprocess
communications.  Can be run in preforking mode, threaded,
asynchronous/evented and supports various form of green threads/co-routine
(like uGreen and Fiber).  Sysadmin will love it as it can be configured via
command line, environment variables, xml, .ini and yaml files and via LDAP.

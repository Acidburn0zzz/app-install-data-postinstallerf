Pyro provides an object-oriented form of RPC. You can use Pyro within a
single system but also use it for IPC. For those that are familiar with
Java, Pyro resembles Javas Remote Method Invocation (RMI). It is less
similar to CORBA - which is a system- and language independent Distributed
Object Technology and has much more to offer than Pyro or RMI.

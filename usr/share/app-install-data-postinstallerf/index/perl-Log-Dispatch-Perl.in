Comment3='
The "LogDispatchPerl" module offers a logging alternative using
standard Perl core functions. It allows you to fall back to the common Perl
alternatives for logging, such as "warn" and "cluck". It also adds the
possibility for a logging action to halt the current environment, such as
with "die" and "croak".

Killbots is a simple game of evading killer robots. Who created the robots
and why they have been programmed to destroy, no one knows. All that is known
is that the robots are numerous and their sole objective is to destroy you.
Fortunately for you, their creator has focused on quantity rather than quality
and as a result the robots are severely lacking in intelligence. Your superior
wit and a fancy teleportation device are your only weapons against the
never-ending stream of mindless automatons.

ReflectASM is a very small Java library that provides
high performance reflection by using code generation.
An access class is generated to set/get fields,
call methods, or create a new instance. The access class
uses byte-code rather than Javas reflection, so it
is much faster. It can also access primitive fields
via byte-code to avoid boxing.

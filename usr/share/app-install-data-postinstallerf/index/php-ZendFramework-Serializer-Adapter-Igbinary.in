Igbinary is Open Source Software released by Sulake Dynamoid Oy. Its a drop-in
replacement for the standard PHP serializer. Instead of time and space
consuming textual representation, igbinary stores PHP data structures in a
compact binary form. Savings are significant when using memcached or similar
memory based storages for serialized data.

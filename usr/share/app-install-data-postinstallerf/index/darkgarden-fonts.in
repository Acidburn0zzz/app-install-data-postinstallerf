Dark Garden is a decorative outline font of unusual shape.
The typeface is based on authors original hand drawings.
The letterform is complex, with all characters decorated
with spikes resembling thorns or flames, character spacing
is very dense. Such a theme makes it a great font for titles,
banners, logos etc. Due to the fonts complicated form,
long text passages are not very legible, but short paragraphs
such as titles or lyrics / poetry look very well.

vmmlib is a vector and matrix math library implemented using C++ templates.
Its basic functionality includes a vector and a matrix class, with additional
functionality for the often-used 3d and 4d vectors and 3x3 and 4x4 matrices.
More advanced functionality include solvers, frustum computations and frustum
culling classes, and spatial data structures.

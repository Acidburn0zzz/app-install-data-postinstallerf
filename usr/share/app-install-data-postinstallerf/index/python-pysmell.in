PySmell is a python IDE completion helper.

It tries to statically analyze Python source code, without executing it, and
generates information about a projects structure that IDE tools can use.
PySmell currently supports Vim, Emacs and TextMate. It can be integrated with
any editor that can run Python scripts and has an auto-complete API.

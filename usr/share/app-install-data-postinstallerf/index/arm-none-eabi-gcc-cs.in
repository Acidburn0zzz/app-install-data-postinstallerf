Comment3='
This is a Cross Compiling version of GNU GCC, which can be used to
compile for the arm-none-eabi platform, instead of for the
native x86_64 platform.

This package is based on the CodeSourcery 2013.11-24 release,
which includes improved ARM target support compared to the corresponding
GNU GCC release.

The bundle offers "minimal" markup syntax for various simple
kinds of text. The user will typically involve little more than
is printed, and will still get LaTeX quality. The bundle
provides four packages - wiki addresses general texts, marked
up in the simple style used on Wikipedia; - niceverb is yet
another means of documenting LaTeX packages it offers syntax-
aware typesetting of meta-variables (macro arguments) and for
referring to commands (and their syntax) in footnotes, section
titles etc.; - fifinddo aims to parse plain text or (La)TeX
files using TeX, and to write the results to an external file;

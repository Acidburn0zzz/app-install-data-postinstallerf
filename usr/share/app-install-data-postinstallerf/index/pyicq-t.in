Comment3='
The ICQ Transport provides a gateway which allows Jabber users to
communicate with their contacts on the ICQ network.

The transport must be installed on the Jabber server, and its
operation is nearly transparent to the user. They can interact with
their ICQ contacts in the same way as they do with their Jabber
contacts.

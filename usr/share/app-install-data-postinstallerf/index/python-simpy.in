SimPy (= Simulation in Python) is an object-oriented, process-based
discrete-event simulation language based on standard Python. It
provides the modeler with components of a simulation model including
processes, for active components like customers, messages, and
vehicles, and resources, for passive components that form limited
capacity congestion points like servers, checkout counters, and
tunnels. It also provides monitor variables to aid in gathering
statistics. Random variates are provided by the standard Python random
module.

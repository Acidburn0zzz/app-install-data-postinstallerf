Comment3='
This package provides a library that adds ZRTP support to the GNU
ccRTP stack. Phil Zimmermann developed ZRTP to allow ad-hoc, easy to
use key negotiation to setup Secure RTP (SRTP) sessions. GNU ZRTP
together with GNU ccRTP (1.5.0 or later) provides a ZRTP
implementation that can be directly embedded into client and server
applications.

The purpose of this tool is to gather as much information as possible about a
domain. The program currently gathers A, NS, MX records, performs axfr queries,
gets extra names and subdomains via google scraping, bruteforces subdomains from
file, calculate C class domain network ranges and perform whois queries on them,
perform reverse lookups on netranges, writes ip-blocks to domain_ips.txt.

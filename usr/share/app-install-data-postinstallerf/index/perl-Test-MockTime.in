This module was created to enable test suites to test code at specific
points in time. Specifically it overrides localtime, gmtime and time at
compile time and then relies on the user supplying a mock time via
set_relative_time, set_absolute_time or set_fixed_time to alter future
calls to gmtime,time or localtime.

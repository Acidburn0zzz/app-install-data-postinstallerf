Conspy allows a (possibly remote) user to see what is displayed on
a Linux virtual console, and send keystrokes to it. It is rather
like VNC, but where VNC takes control of a GUI conspy takes control
of a text mode virtual console. Unlike VNC, conspy does not require
a server to be installed prior to being used.

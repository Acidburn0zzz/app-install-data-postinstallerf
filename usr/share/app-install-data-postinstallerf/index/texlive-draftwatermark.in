The package provides a means to add a textual, light grey
watermark on every page or on the first page of a document.
Typical usage may consist in writing words such as DRAFT or
CONFIDENTIAL across document pages. The package performs a
similar function to that of draftcopy, but its implementation
is output device independent, and very made simple by relying
on everpage.

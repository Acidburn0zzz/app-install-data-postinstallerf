Comment3='
Some commonly used perl modules dont have SSL support at all, even if the
protocol would support it. Others have SSL support, but most of them dont
do proper checking of the servers certificate.

The NetSSLGlue* modules try to add SSL support or proper certificate to
these modules. Currently is support for the following modules available
- NetSMTP - add SSL from beginning or using STARTTLS
- NetLDAP - add proper certificate checking
- LWP - add proper certificate checking

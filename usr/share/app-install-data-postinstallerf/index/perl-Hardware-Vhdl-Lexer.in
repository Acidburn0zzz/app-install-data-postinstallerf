Comment3='
HardwareVhdlLexer splits VHDL code into lexical tokens. To use it, you
need to first create a lexer object, passing in something which will supply
chunks of VHDL code to the lexer. Repeated calls to the get_next_token
method of the lexer will then return VHDL tokens (in scalar context) or a
token type code and the token (in list context). get_next_token returns
undef when there are no more tokens to be read.

Comment3='
This is a cross-compilation version of GNU Binutils, which can be used to
assemble and link binaries for the arm-none-eabi platform.

This Binutils package is based on the CodeSourcery
2013.11-24 release, which includes improved ARM target
support compared to the corresponding FSF release.  CodeSourcery
contributes their changes to the FSF, but it takes a while for them to
get merged.  For the ARM target, effectively CodeSourcery is upstream
of FSF.

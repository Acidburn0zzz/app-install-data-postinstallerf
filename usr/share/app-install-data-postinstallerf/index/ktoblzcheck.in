KtoBLZCheck is a library to check account numbers and bank codes of
German banks. Both a library for other programs as well as a short
command-line tool is available. It is possible to check pairs of
account numbers and bank codes (BLZ) of German banks, and to map bank
codes (BLZ) to the clear-text name and location of the bank.

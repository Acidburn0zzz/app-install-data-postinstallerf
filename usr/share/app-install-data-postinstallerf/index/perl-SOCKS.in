This is a SOCKS client module that can communicate with SOCKS v4 and v5
servers.  It currently allows you to make outgoing and incoming TCP
connections.  UDP is not yet supported and is first on the TODO list.
Included in this distribution is a sample program called "example" to show
you how to use this module.  NetSOCKS documentation is available on your
system by doing a "perldoc NetSOCKS".

VIGRA stands for "Vision with Generic Algorithms". Its a novel computer vision
library that puts its main emphasis on customizable algorithms and data
structures. By using template techniques similar to those in the C++ Standard
Template Library, you can easily adapt any VIGRA component to the needs of your
application without thereby giving up execution speed.

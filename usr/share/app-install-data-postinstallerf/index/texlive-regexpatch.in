Comment='<span size="xx-large">High level patching of commands</span>'
Comment3='
The package generalises the macro patching commands provided by
P. Lehmanns etoolbox. The difference between this package and
its sibling xpatch is that this package sports a very powerful
\regexpatchcmd based on the l3regex module of the LaTeX3
experimental packages.

Comment3='
Provides a CAPTCHA for Python using the reCAPTCHA service. Does not require
any imaging libraries because the CAPTCHA is served directly from reCAPTCHA.
Also allows you to securely obfuscate emails with Mailhide. This functionality
requires python-crypto. This library requires two types of API keys. If youd
like to use the CAPTCHA, youll need a key from
http//recaptcha.net/api/getkey. For Mailhide, youll need a key from
http//mailhide.recaptcha.net/apikey.

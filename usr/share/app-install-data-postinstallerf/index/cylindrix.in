Cylindrix is a 3-on-3 combat game with 360 degrees of freedom that is
similar to Spectre VR but with a wider variety of ships, as well as the
addition of drivers. Attack and be attacked from all angles as you battle
in huge orbiting arenas that are each unique in physics, atmospheric
conditions, and configuration. You must build your team from 37 warriors
from 10 alien races and select from 8 vehicles, each with unique
maneuverability, speed, and firepower. The graphics are good, although
structure and ship graphics are a little too monotonous. Gameplay is fast
and furious... so furious, in fact, that it is difficult to differentiate
between friend and foe in the thick of battle. For those who are confident

The bundle provides several packages for commonly-needed
support for typesetting theorems. The packages should work with
kernel theorems (theorems out of the box with LaTeX), and the
theorem and amsthm packages. Features of the bundle include -
a key-value interface to \newtheorem; - a \listoftheorems
command; - hyperref and autoref compatibility; - a mechanism
for restating entire theorems in a single macro call.

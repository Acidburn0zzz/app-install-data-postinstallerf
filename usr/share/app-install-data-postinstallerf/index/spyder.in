Spyder is a Python development environment with advanced editing, interactive
testing, debugging and introspection features. It is especially recommended
for scientific computing thanks to NumPy (linear algebra), SciPy (signal and
image processing), matplotlib (interactive 2D/3D plotting), MayaVi?s mlab
(interactive 3D visualization) and -of course- IPython support.

Spyder may also be used as a library providing powerful console-related PyQt4
widgets.

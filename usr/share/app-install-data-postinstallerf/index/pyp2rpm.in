Comment3='
Convert Python packages to RPM SPECFILES. The packages can be downloaded from
PyPI and the produced SPEC is in line with Fedora Packaging Guidelines.

Users
can provide their own templates for rendering the package metadata. Both the
package
source and metadata can be extracted from PyPI or from local filesystem
(local file doesnt
provide that much information though).

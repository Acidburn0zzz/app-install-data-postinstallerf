Comment3='
Xml2rfc generates RFCs and IETF drafts from document source in XML
according to the dtd in RFC-2629.  It takes as input an xml file which
contains the text and meta-information about author names etc., and
transforms it into suitably formatted output. The input xml file should
follow the DTD given in RFC-2629 (or its unofficial successor).

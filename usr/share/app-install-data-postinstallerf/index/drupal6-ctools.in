This suite is primarily a set of APIs and tools to improve the developer
experience. It also contains a module called the Page Manager whose job
is to manage pages. In particular it manages panel pages, but as it grows
it will be able to manage far more than just Panels.

For the moment, it includes the following tools
      plugins from .inc files.
      in database or live in code, such as default views.

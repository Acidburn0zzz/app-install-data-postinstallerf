libXau provides mechanisms for individual access to an X Window
System display. It uses existing core protocol and library hooks for
specifying authorization data in the connection setup block to
restrict use of the display to only those clients that show that they
know a server-specific key called a "magic cookie".

This package contains all necessary include files and libraries
needed to develop applications that require these.

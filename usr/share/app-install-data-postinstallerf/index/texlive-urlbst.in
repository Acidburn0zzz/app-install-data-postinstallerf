Comment='<span size="xx-large">Web support for BibTeX</span>'
Comment3='
Supports a new BibTeX webpage entry type and url,
lastchecked, and eprint and DOI fields. The Perl script
urlbst can be used to add this support to an arbitrary .bst
file which has a reasonably conventional structure. The result
is meant to be robust rather than pretty.

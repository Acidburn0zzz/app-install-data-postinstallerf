The GPL Electronic Design Automation (gEDA) project has produced and
continues working on a full GPLd suite and toolkit of Electronic
Design Automation tools. These tools are used for electrical circuit
design, schematic capture, simulation, prototyping, and production.

Currently, the gEDA project offers a mature suite of free software
applications for electronics design, including schematic capture,
attribute management, bill of materials (BOM) generation, netlisting
into over 20 netlist formats, analog and digital simulation, and
printed circuit board (PCB) layout.

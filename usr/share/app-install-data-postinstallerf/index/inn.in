Comment3='
INN (InterNetNews) is a complete system for serving Usenet news and/or
private newsfeeds.  INN includes innd, an NNTP (NetNews Transport
Protocol) server, and nnrpd, a newsreader that is spawned for each
client.  Both innd and nnrpd vary slightly from the NNTP protocol, but
not in ways that are easily noticed.

Install the inn package if you need a complete system for serving and
reading Usenet news.  You may also need to install inn-devel, if you
are going to use a separate program which interfaces to INN, like
newsgate or tin.

Comment3='
This module offers an abstraction of a credential, i.e. something that
can be used to authenticate. It allows the creation and manipulation of
credentials. In particular, it defines a standard string representation
(so that credentials can be given to external programs as command line
options), a standard structured representation (so that credentials can
be stored in structured configuration files or using JSON) and
"preparators" that can transform credentials into ready-to-use data for
well known targets.

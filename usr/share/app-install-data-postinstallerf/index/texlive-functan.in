Comment3='
This package provides a convenient and coherent way to deal
with name of functional spaces (mainly Sobolev spaces) in
functional analysis and PDE theory. It also provides a set of
macros for dealing with norms, scalar products and convergence
with some object oriented flavor (it gives the possibility to
override the standard behavior of norms, ...).

KTuberling a simple constructor game suitable for children and adults
alike. The idea of the game is based around a once popular doll making
concept. A potato was decorated with various small artifacts to make it
look more like a tiny person. KTuberling however, goes much further in
terms of content and adds a surprising variety of different themes.

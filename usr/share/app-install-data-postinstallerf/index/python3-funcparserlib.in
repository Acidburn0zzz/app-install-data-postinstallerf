Parser combinators are just higher-order functions that take parsers as their
arguments and return them as result values. Parser combinators are
* First-class values
* Extremely composable
* Tend to make the code quite compact
* Resemble the readable notation of xBNF grammars

Parsers made with funcparserlib are pure-Python LL(*) parsers. It means that
its very easy to write them without thinking about look-aheads and all that
hardcore parsing stuff. But the recursive descent parsing is a rather slow

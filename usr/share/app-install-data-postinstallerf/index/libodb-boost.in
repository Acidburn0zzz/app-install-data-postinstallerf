ODB is an object-relational mapping (ORM) system for C++. It provides
tools, APIs, and library support that allow you to persist C++ objects
to a relational database (RDBMS) without having to deal with tables,
columns, or SQL and without manually writing any of the mapping code.

This package contains the Boost ODB profile library. The Boost profile
provides support for persisting Boost smart pointers, containers, and
value types with the ODB system.

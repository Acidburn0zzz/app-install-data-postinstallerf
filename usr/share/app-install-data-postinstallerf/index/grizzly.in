Comment3='
Writing scalable server applications in the Java programming
language has always been difficult. Before the advent of the
Java New I/O API (NIO), thread management issues made it
impossible for a server to scale to thousands of users. The
Grizzly framework has been designed to help developers to take
advantage of the Java NIO API. Originally developed under the
GlassFish umbrella, the framework is now available as a
standalone project. Grizzly goals is to help developers to
build scalable and robust servers using NIO.

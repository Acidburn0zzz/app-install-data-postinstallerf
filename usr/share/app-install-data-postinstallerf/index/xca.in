  X Certificate and Key management is a graphic interface for managing
asymmetric keys like RSA or DSA, certificates and revocation lists. It is
intended as a small CA for creation and signing certificates. It uses the
OpenSSL library for the cryptographic operations.
  Certificate signing requests (PKCS#10), certificates (X509v3), the signing
of requests, the creation of self-signed certificates, certificate revocation
lists and SmartCards are supported. For an easy company-wide use, customizable
templates can be used for certificate and request generation. The PKI structures
can be imported and exported in several formats like PKCS#7, PKCS#12, PEM,
DER, PKCS#8. All cryptographic data are stored in a byte order agnostic file

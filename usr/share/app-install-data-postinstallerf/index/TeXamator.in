TeXamator is written in Python/Qt4. It is aimed at helping you making your
exercise sheets. Basically, it browses a specified directory, looks for .tex
files containing exercises and builds a tree with all your exercises in it. You
can click on an element of the tree to have a preview of the exercise and add
it to a list if you wish to. Then you can save your work to a .tex file or you
can generate a .dvi file.

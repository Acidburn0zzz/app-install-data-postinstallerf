gentoo is a file manager for Linux written from scratch in pure C. It
uses the GTK2 toolkit for all of its interface needs. gentoo provides
100% GUI configurability; no need to edit config files by hand and re-
start the program. gentoo supports identifying the type of various
files (using extension, regular expressions, and/or the file command),
and can display files of different types with different colors and icons.
gentoo borrows some of its look and feel from the classic Amiga
file manager "Directory OPUS"(TM) (written by Jonathan Potter).

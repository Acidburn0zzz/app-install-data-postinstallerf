Comment3='
This package provides a software library for manipulating ID3v1 and
ID3v2 tags. It provides a convenient interface for software developers
to include standards-compliant ID3v1/2 tagging capabilities in their
applications. Features include identification of valid tags, automatic
size conversions, (re)synchronisation of tag frames, seamless tag
(de)compression, and optional padding facilities. Additionally, it can
tell mp3 header info, like bitrate etc.
This is the MinGW version, built for the win32 target.

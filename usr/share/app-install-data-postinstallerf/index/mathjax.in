MathJax is an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML,
and AsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers. It requires no
setup on the part of the user (no plugins to download or software to
install), so the page author can write web documents that include
mathematics and be confident that users will be able to view it
naturally and easily. Supports LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation
in HTML pages.

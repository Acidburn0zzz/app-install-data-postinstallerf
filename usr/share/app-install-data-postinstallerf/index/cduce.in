CDuce is a modern XML-oriented functional language with innovative
features. A compiler is available under the terms of an open-source
license. CDuce is type-safe, efficient, and offers powerful
constructions to work with XML documents.

For ocamlduce (the modified OCaml language which incorporates CDuce
extensions), please install the cduce-ocamlduce package.

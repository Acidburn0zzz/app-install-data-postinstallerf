Cobbler is a network install server.  Cobbler supports PXE,
virtualized installs, and re-installing existing Linux machines.  The
last two modes use a helper tool, koan, that integrates with
cobbler.  There is also a web interface cobbler-web.  Cobblers
advanced features include importing distributions from DVDs and rsync
mirrors, kickstart templating, integrated yum mirroring, and built-in
DHCP/DNS Management.  Cobbler has a XMLRPC API for integration with
other applications.

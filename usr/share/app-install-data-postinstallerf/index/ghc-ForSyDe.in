Comment3='
The ForSyDe (Formal System Design) methodology has been developed with
the objective to move system design to a higher level of abstraction
and to bridge the abstraction gap by transformational design refinement.
This library provides ForSyDes implementation as a Haskell-embedded
Domain Specific Language (DSL). For more information, please see
ForSyDes website <http//www.ict.kth.se/forsyde/>.  This will be
most probably the last update on this package. It will be splitted to
ForSyDe-shallow and ForSyDe-deep in the next release.

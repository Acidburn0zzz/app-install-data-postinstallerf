Comment3='
A Dragon 32, Dragon 64 and Tandy CoCo emulator for Unix, Linux, GP32, MacOS X
and Windows32. It uses standard cassette images (".cas" files) and virtual
diskettes (".dsk" or ".vdk" files) but has its own snapshot format at the
moment (no ".pak" file support).

ROM images of the firmware are required for full emulation but a 3rd party
minimal firmware is included.

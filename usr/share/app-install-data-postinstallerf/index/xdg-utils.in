The xdg-utils package is a set of simple scripts that provide basic
desktop integration functions for any Free Desktop, such as Linux.
They are intended to provide a set of defacto standards.
This means that
*  Third party software developers can rely on these xdg-utils
   for all of their simple integration needs.
*  Developers of desktop environments can make sure that their
   environments are well supported
*  Distribution vendors can provide custom versions of these utilities

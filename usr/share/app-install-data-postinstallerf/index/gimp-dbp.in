Davids Batch Processor (DBP) is a simple batch processing plugin for the Gimp.
It allows the user to automatically perform operations, such as re-size, on a
collection of image files. Its main advantage is that the user does not have to
learn a scripting language. Like the Gimp itself, DBP relies on a graphical
interface.

Simplified DocBook is an attempt to provide a proper subset of DocBook
that is simultaneously smaller and still useful. Documents written in
the subset must be 100% legal DocBook documents. This is a subset for
single documents (articles, white papers, etc.), so theres no need
for books or sets, just articles. Simplified DocBook documents are
viewable in online browsers if styled with CSS. (its XML not SGML).

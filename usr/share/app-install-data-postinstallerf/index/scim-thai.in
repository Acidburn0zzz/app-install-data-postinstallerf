Comment3='
SCIM-Thai is a SCIM IMEngine module for Thai, based on the libthai library.

Currently, it supports Ketmanee, TIS-820.2538, and Pattachote keybaord layouts
and can validate input sequences at 3 levels of strictness.
For applications that support surrounding text retrieval/deleting,
it also corrects invalid input sequences.

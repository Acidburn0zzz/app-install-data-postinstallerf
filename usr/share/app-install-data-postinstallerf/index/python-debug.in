Comment3='
python-debug provides a version of the Python runtime with numerous debugging
features enabled, aimed at advanced Python users, such as developers of Python
extension modules.

This version uses more memory and will be slower than the regular Python build,
but is useful for tracking down reference-counting issues, and other bugs.
The bytecodes are unchanged, so that .pyc files are compatible between the two
version of Python, but the debugging features mean that C/C++ extension modules
are ABI-incompatible with those built for the standard runtime.

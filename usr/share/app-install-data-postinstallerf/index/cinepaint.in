CinePaint is used for motion picture frame-by-frame retouching, dirt removal,
wire rig removal, render repair, background plates, and 3d model textures.
Its been used on many feature films, including The Last Samurai where it was
used to add flying arrows. Its also being used by pro photographers who need
greater color fidelity than is available in other tools.

Comment3='
Out of the box Moose only provides very barebones cloning support in order
to maximize flexibility.

This role provides a clone method that makes use of the low level cloning
support already in Moose and adds selective deep cloning based on
introspection on top of that. Attributes with the Clone trait will handle
cloning of data within the object, typically delegating to the attribute
values own clone method.

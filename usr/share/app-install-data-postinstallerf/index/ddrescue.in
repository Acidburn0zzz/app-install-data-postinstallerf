GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool. It copies data from one file or block
device (hard disc, cd-rom, etc) to another, trying hard to rescue data in
case of read errors. GNU ddrescue does not truncate the output file if not
asked to. So, every time you run it on the same output file, it tries to
fill in the gaps.

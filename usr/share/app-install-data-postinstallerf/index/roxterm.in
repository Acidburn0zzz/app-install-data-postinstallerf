ROXTerm is a terminal emulator intended to provide similar
features to gnome-terminal, based on the same VTE library,
but with a smaller footprint and quicker start-up time. It
achieves this by not using the Gnome libraries and by using
a separate applet to provide the configuration GUI. It can
be used as a ROX application, as the name implies, or in
any other X environment.

SSM is a macromolecular coordinate superposition library, written by
Eugene Krissinel.

The library implements the SSM algorithm of protein structure
comparison in three dimensions, which includes an original procedure
of matching graphs built on the proteins secondary-structure

protein backbone Calpha atoms.
The algorithm implemented by the software is described in

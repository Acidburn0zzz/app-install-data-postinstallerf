This application is especially designed for generating an image
(e.g. PNG) from a LaTeX equation, this using a nice GUI. Support
for Copy-Paste, Save as image/pdf/ps and drag-and-drop is included.
The program has two modes, shrinked and expanded mode. Shrinked
mode is straightforward, and expanded mode lets you to specify
a few options. You can use KLatexFormula in command-line mode
(eg. for scripts) by invoking klatexformula_cmdl executable.

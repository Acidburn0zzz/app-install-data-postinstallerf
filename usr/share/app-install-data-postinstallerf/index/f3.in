F3 is a utility to test for fake flash drives and cards. It is a Free
Software alternative to h2testw.  f3write will fill the unused part of
a filesystem with files NNNN.fff with known content, and f3read will
analyze the files to determine whether the contents are corrupted, as
happens with fake flash.

Comment3='
This is a small package of macros for creating cubic spline
interpolants in MetaPost or MetaFont. Given a list of points
the macros can produce a closed or a relaxed spline joining
them. Given a list of function values y_j at x_j, the result
would define the graph of a cubic spline interpolating function
y=f(x), which is either periodic or relaxed.

XForms is a GUI toolkit based on Xlib for X Window Systems. It
features a rich set of objects, such as buttons, sliders, and menus
etc. integrated into an easy and efficient object/event callback
execution model that allows fast and easy construction of
X-applications. In addition, the library is extensible and new objects
can easily be created and added to the library.

A macro package for typesetting scholarly critical editions.
The ledmac package is a LaTeX port of the plain TeX EDMAC
macros. It supports indexing by page and line number and simple
tabular- and array-style environments. The package is
distributed with the related ledpar and ledarab packages. The
package is now superseded by eledmac.

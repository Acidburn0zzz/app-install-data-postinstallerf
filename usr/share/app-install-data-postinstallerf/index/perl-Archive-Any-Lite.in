This is a fork of ArchiveAny by Michael Schwern and Clint Moore. The main
difference is that this works properly even when you fork(), and may require
less memory to extract a tarball. On the other hand, this isnt pluggable
(it only supports file formats used in the CPAN toolchains), and it doesnt
check MIME types.

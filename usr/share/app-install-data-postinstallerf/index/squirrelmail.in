SquirrelMail is a basic webmail package written in PHP4. It
includes built-in pure PHP support for the IMAP and SMTP protocols, and
all pages render in pure HTML 4.0 (with no JavaScript) for maximum
compatibility across browsers.  It has very few requirements and is very
easy to configure and install.

Comment3='
Saxon HE is Saxonicas non-schema-aware implementation of the XPath 2.0,
XSLT 2.0, and XQuery 1.0 specifications aligned with the W3C Candidate
Recommendation published on 3 November 2005. It is a complete and
conformant implementation, providing all the mandatory features of
those specifications and nearly all the optional features.

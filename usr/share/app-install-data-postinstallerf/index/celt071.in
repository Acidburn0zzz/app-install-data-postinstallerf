CELT (Constrained Energy Lapped Transform) is an ultra-low delay audio
codec designed for realtime transmission of high quality speech and audio.
This is meant to close the gap between traditional speech codecs
(such as Speex) and traditional audio codecs (such as Vorbis).

The CELT bitstream format is not yet stable, this package is a special
version of 0.7.1 that has the same bitstream format, but symbols and files
renamed from celt* to celt071* so that it is parallel installable with
the normal celt for packages requiring this particular bitstream format.

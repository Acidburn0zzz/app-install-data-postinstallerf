Comment3='
Typespeed gives your fingers cps (total and correct), typoratio and
some points to compare with your friends.

Typespeeds idea is ripped from ztspeed (a DOS game made by
Zorlim). The idea behind the game is rather easy type words that are
flying by from left to right as fast as you can. If you miss 10 or
more words, game is over.
You can play typespeed for your own or with a friend using TCP/IPv4.

The float package provides commands to define new floats of
various styles (plain, boxed, ruled, and userdefined ones); the
rotating package provides new environments (sidewaysfigure and
sidewaystable) which are rotated by 90 or 270 degrees. But what
about new rotated floats, e.g. a rotated ruled one? This
package makes this possible; it builds a bridge between the two
packages and extends the commands from the float package to
define rotated versions of the new floats, too.

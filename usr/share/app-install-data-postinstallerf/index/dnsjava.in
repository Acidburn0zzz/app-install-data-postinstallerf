dnsjava is an implementation of DNS in Java. It supports all of the common
record types and the DNSSEC types. It can be used for queries, zone transfers,
and dynamic updates. It includes a cache which can be used by clients, and a
minimal implementation of a server. It supports TSIG authenticated messages,
partial DNSSEC verification, and EDNS0.

dnsjava provides functionality above and beyond that of the InetAddress class.
Since it is written in pure Java, dnsjava is fully threadable, and in many
cases is faster than using InetAddress.

Comment3='
python-sanction is a lightweight, dead simple client implementation of
the OAuth2 protocol.

- Variations on OAuth2 client implementation range from a few hundred LOC
  to thousands. In a Pythonic world, theres absolutely no need for this when
  simply dealing with the client side of the spec. Currently, sanction sits
  at a whopping 65 LOC, one class. This makes the library tremendously easy
  to grok.
- Most providers have varying levels of diversion from the official spec.

Comment3='
FileInplace is a perl module intended to ease the common task of editing
a file in-place. Inspired by variations of perls -i option, this module is
intended for somewhat more structured and reusable editing than command
line perl typically allows. FileInplace endeavors to guarantee file
integrity; that is, either all of the changes made will be saved to the
file, or none will. It also offers functionality such as backup creation,
automatic field splitting per-line, automatic chomping/unchomping, and
aborting edits partially through without affecting the original file.

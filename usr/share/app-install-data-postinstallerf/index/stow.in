GNU Stow is a program for managing the installation of software packages,
keeping them separate (/usr/local/stow/emacs vs. /usr/local/stow/perl, for
example) while making them appear to be installed in the same place
(/usr/local). Software to ease the keeping track of software built from
source, making it easy to install, delete, move etc.

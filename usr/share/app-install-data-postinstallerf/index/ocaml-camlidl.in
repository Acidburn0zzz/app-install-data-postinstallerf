Comment3='
CamlIDL is a stub code generator and COM binding for Objective Caml.

CamlIDL comprises two parts
* A stub code generator that generates the C stub code required for
  the Caml/C interface, based on an MIDL specification. (MIDL stands
  for Microsofts Interface Description Language; it looks like C
  header files with some extra annotations, plus a notion of object
  interfaces that look like C++ classes without inheritance.)
* A (currently small) library of functions and tools to import COM
  components in Caml applications, and export Caml code as COM
  components.

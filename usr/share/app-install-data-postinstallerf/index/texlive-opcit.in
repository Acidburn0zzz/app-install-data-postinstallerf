This package addresses the problem of expressing citations in a
style that is natural for humanities studies, yet does not
interfere with the flow of text (as author-year styles do). The
package differs from footbib in that it uses real footnotes,
potentially in the same series as any of the documents other
footnotes. Opcit also, as its name implies, avoids repetition
of full citations, achieving this, to a large extent,
automatically.

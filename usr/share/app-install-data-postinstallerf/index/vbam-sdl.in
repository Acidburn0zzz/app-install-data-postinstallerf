This package provides the non GUI SDL version of VisualBoyAdvance-M.
VisualBoyAdvance-M is a Nintendo Game Boy Emulator with high compatibility with
commercial games. It emulates the Nintendo Game Boy Advance hand held console,
in addition to the original Game Boy hand held systems and its Super and Color
variants. VBA-M is a continued development of the now inactive VisualBoy
Advance project, with many improvements from various developments of VBA.

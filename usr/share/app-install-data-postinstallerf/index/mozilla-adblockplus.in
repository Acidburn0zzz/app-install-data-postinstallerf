Adblock Plus is a content-filtering extension for the Mozilla Firefox- and
Mozilla Application Suite-based web browsers. Adblock Plus allows users to
prevent page elements, such as advertisements, from being downloaded and
displayed.
It features improvements to the user interface, filter subscriptions, and
element hiding over the original Adblock extension.

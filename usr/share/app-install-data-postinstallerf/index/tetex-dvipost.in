The command dvipost is a post procesor for dvi files, created by latex
or tex. It is used for special modes, which normally needs the support
of dvi drivers (such as dvips). With dvipost, this features could be
implemented independent of the preferred driver. Currently, the post
processor supports layout raster, change bars and overstrike mode.

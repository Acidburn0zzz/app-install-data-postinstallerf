Comment3='
Kyua (pronounced Q.A.) is a testing framework for both developers and
users.  Kyua is different from most other testing frameworks in that it
puts the end user experience before anything else.  There are multiple
reasons for users to run the tests themselves, and Kyua ensures that
they can do so in the most convenient way.

This module, kyua-testers, provides scriptable interfaces to interact
with test programs of various kinds.  The interface of such testers
allows the caller to execute a single test case of a single test program
in a controlled and homogeneous manner.

Comment3='
This is a utility which takes a TrueType font as the input, removes its
bytecode instructions (if any), and returns a new font where all glyphs
are bytecode hinted using the information given by FreeTypes autohinting
module. The idea is to provide the excellent quality of the autohinter on
platforms which dont use FreeType.

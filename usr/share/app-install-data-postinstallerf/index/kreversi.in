Comment3='
Kreversi is a simple one player strategy game played against the
computer. The playing field is an 8 by 8 square board divided into 64
squares. The game pieces used are two sided stones, where each side has
its own, distinctive color. If a piece is captured by an opposing player,
that piece is turned over to reveal the color of that player. A winner
is declared when one player has more pieces of his own color on the
board and there are no more possible moves.

GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
which operate on media data.

GStreamer Good Plugins is a collection of well-supported plugins of
good quality and under the LGPL license.
gstreamer1-plugins-good-extras contains extra "good" plugins
which are not used very much and require additional libraries
to be installed.

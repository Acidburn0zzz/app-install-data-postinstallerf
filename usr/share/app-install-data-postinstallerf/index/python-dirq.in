Comment3='
The goal of this module is to offer a simple queue system using the
underlying file system for storage, security and to prevent race
conditions via atomic operations.  It focuses on simplicity,
robustness and the ability to scale.

The python module dirq is compatible with the Perl
module DirectoryQueue.

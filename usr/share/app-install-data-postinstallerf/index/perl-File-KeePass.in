Comment3='
FileKeePass gives access to KeePass version 1 (kdb) and
version 2 (kdbx) databases.

The version 1 and version 2 databases are very different
in construction, but the majority of information overlaps
and many algorithms are similar. FileKeePass attempts to
iron out as many of the differences.
FileKeePass gives nearly raw data access. There are a few
 utility methods for manipulating groups and entries. More

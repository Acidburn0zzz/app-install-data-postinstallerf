This project aims to bring the power of the Google Voice API to the
Python language in a simple, easy-to-use manner. Currently it allows
you to place calls, send sms, download voicemails/recorded messages,
and search the various folders of your Google Voice Accounts. You can
use the Python API or command line script to schedule calls, check for
new received calls/sms, or even sync your recorded voicemails/calls.

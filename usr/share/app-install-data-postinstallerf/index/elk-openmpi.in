An all-electron full-potential linearised augmented-plane wave (FP-LAPW) code
with many advanced features. Written originally at
Karl-Franzens-Universit?t Graz as a milestone of the EXCITING EU Research and
Training Network, the code is designed to be as simple as possible so that new
developments in the field of density functional theory (DFT) can be added
quickly and reliably.
This package contains the openmpi version.

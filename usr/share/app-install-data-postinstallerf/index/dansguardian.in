Comment3='
DansGuardian filters the content of pages based on many methods including
phrase matching, PICS filtering and URL filtering. It does not purely filter
based on a banned list of sites.

It provides real-time virus scanning capabilities for content access.
DansGuardian is designed to be completely flexible and allows you to tailor the
filtering to your exact needs. It can be as draconian or as unobstructive as
you want. The default settings are geared towards what a primary school might
want but DansGuardian puts you in control of what you want to block.

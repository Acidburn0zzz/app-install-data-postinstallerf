Comment3='
JDiff is a Javadoc doclet which generates an HTML
report of all the packages, classes, constructors,
methods, and fields which have been removed, added
or changed in any way, including their documentation,
when two APIs are compared. This is very useful for
describing exactly what has changed between two
releases of a product. Only the API (Application
Programming Interface) of each version is compared.
It does not compare what the source code does when
executed.

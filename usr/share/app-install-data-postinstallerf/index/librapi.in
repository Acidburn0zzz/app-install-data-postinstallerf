The RAPI library is an open source implementation that works like RAPI.DLL,
available on Microsoft operating systems. The library makes it possible to make
remote calls to a computer running Pocket PC.
In order to use librapi, a daemon that the Pocket PC client connects to must be
running on the computer using librapi.

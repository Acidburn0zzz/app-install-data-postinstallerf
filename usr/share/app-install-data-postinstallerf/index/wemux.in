wemux enhances tmux to make multi-user terminal multiplexing both easier and
more powerful. It allows users to host a wemux server and have clients join
in either

**Mirror Mode** gives clients (another SSH user on your machine) read-only
access to the session, allowing them to see you work, or
**Pair Mode** allows the client and yourself to work in the same terminal
(shared cursor)

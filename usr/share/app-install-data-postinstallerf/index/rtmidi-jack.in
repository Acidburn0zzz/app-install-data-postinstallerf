RtMidi is a set of C++ classes (RtMidiIn and RtMidiOut) that provides a common
API (Application Programming Interface) for realtime MIDI input/output across
Linux (ALSA & Jack), Macintosh OS X, Windows (Multimedia Library), and SGI
operating systems. RtMidi significantly simplifies the process of interacting
with computer MIDI hardware and software. It was designed with the following
goals
* object oriented C++ design
* simple, common API across all supported platforms
* only two header files and one source file for easy inclusion in programming

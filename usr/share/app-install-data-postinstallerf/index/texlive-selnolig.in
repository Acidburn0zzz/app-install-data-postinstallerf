Comment3='
The package suppresses typographic ligatures selectively, i.e.,
based on predefined search patterns. The search patterns focus
on ligatures deemed inappropriate because they span morpheme
boundaries. For example, the word shelfful, which is mentioned
in the TeXbook as a word for which the ff ligature might be
inappropriate, is automatically typeset as shelf\/ful rather
than as shel{ff}ul. For English and German language documents,
the package provides extensive rules for the selective
suppression of so-called "common" ligatures. These comprise the
ff, fi, fl, ffi, and ffl ligatures as well as the ft and fft

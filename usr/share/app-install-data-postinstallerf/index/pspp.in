PSPP is a program for statistical analysis of sampled data. It
interprets commands in the SPSS language and produces tabular
output in ASCII, PostScript, or HTML format.

PSPP development is ongoing. It already supports a large subset
of SPSSs transformation language. Its statistical procedure
support is currently limited, but growing.

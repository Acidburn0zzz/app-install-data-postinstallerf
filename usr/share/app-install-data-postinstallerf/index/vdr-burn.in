Comment3='
This plugin enables VDR to write compliant DVDs from VDR recordings
while being able to control the process and to watch progress from
inside VDRs on-screen-display.  If the selected recordings dont fit
the DVD, the video tracks are requantized (shrinked) automatically.
The created menus support multipage descriptions (in case the
recording summary exceeds one page).

Whatsup is a cluster node up/down detection utility.

Whatsup can quickly calculate and output the up and down nodes of a cluster.
Whatsup allows some tools, such as Pdsh, to operate more quickly by
not operating on down nodes. Whatsup calculates the up and down nodes of a
cluster through one of several possible backend tools
and several optional cluster node databases.

Comment3='
The package provides macros that collect the content of a
tabular cell, and offer them as an argument to a macro. Special
care is taken to remove all aligning macros inserted by tabular
from the cell content. The macros also work in the last column
of a table, but do not support verbatim material inside the
cells.

Comment3='
mysqlreport makes a friendly report of important MySQL status values.  It
transforms the values from SHOW STATUS into an easy-to-read report that
provides an in-depth understanding of how well MySQL is running, and is a
better alternative (and practically the only alternative) to manually
interpreting SHOW STATUS.

Amarok is a multimedia player with
 - fresh playlist concept, very fast to use, with drag and drop
 - plays all formats supported by the various engines
 - audio effects, like reverb and compressor
 - compatible with the .m3u and .pls formats for playlists
 - nice GUI, integrates into the KDE look, but with a unique touch

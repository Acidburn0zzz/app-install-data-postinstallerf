Comment3='
This module builds upon the existing URL module in Node.js, but adds
relative(source, target) which returns the shortest relative path between
any two equally qualified URLs. If the paths are not equally qualified,
it returns the target.

In addition, this package augments the URL object definition as returned
by parse and consumed by format.

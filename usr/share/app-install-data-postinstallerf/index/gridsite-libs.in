GridSite was originally a web application developed for managing and formatting
the content of the http//www.gridpp.ac.uk/ website. Over the past years it
has grown into a set of extensions to the Apache web server and a toolkit for
Grid credentials, GACL access control lists and HTTP(S) protocol operations.

This package contains the runtime libraries.

Metadata providers for Fedora Infrastructures fedmsg deployment

fedmsg <http//fedmsg.com> is a set of tools for knitting together
services and webapps into a realtime messaging net.  This package contains
metadata provider plugins for the primary deployment of that system
Fedora Infrastructure <http//fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure>.
If you were to deploy fedmsg at another site, you would like want to write
your own module like this one that could provide textual representations of
your messages.

demorse is a non-interactive command line tool for decoding Morse code signals
into text. demorse detects the "dihs" and "dahs" that make a Morse code
character via the computers sound card, which can be connected to a radio
receiver tuned to a CW Morse code transmission or to a tone generator.

The input signal is processed by a Goertzel tone detector which produces "mark"
or "space" (signal/no signal) outputs and the resulting stream of Morse code
"elements" is decoded into an ASCII character for printing to the screen.
Currently demorse is a non- interactive command line tool for the console and
decoded Morse signals are sent to stdout.

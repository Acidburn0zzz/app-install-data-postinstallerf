In the discrete branches of mathematics and the computer
sciences, it will only take some seconds before youre faced
with a set like {1,...,m}. Some people write $1\ldotp\ldotp m$,
others $\{j1\leq j\leq m\}$, and that journal youre
submitting to might want something else entirely. The 12many
package provides an interface that makes changing from one to
another a one-line change.

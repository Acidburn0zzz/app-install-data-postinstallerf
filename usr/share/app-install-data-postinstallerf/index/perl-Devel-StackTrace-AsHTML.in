Comment3='
DevelStackTraceAsHTML adds an as_html method to DevelStackTrace
which displays the stack trace in beautiful HTML, with code snippet
context and function parameters. If you call it on an instance of
DevelStackTraceWithLexicals, you even get to see the lexical
variables of each stack frame.

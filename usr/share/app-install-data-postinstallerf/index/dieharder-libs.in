libdieharder is the core library of dieharder designed to be "the last
suite of random number testers youll ever wear".  It can test any of
its many pre-built and library linked generators (basically all of those
in the Gnu Scientific Library plus a number of others from various
sources) or a potentially random data-set in either an ASCII-formatted
or raw (presumed 32 bit unsigned int) binary file.  It is fairly
straightforward to wrap new software generators for testing, or to add
hardware generators that have a software interface for testing, and the
file input method permits pretty much any software or hardware RNG to be

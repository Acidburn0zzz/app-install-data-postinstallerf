Knuth designed his original fonts with tabular figures (figures
whose width is uniform); this makes some layout problems rather
simple. In more recent times, fonts (such as Minion Pro), which
offer proportionally spaced figures, are increasingly being
used. The package provides mechanisms whereby such proportional
figures may still be aligned in tabular style (for example, in
the table of contents).

This module is a vastly simplified logging system that can do nice stuff.
Think of this module as a dispatcher for various logs.

This module *DOES NOT* do anything significant with logs, it simply routes
them to the appropriate place ( Events )
You register a log that you are interested in, by telling SimpleLog the target
session and target event. Once that is done, any log messages your program
generates ( sent to SimpleLog of course ) will be massaged, then sent to the
target session / target event for processing.

Comment3='
This module is concerned with representing data structures in a textual
notation known as "Pond" (Perl-based open notation for data). The notation
is a strict subset of Perl expression syntax, but is intended to have language-
independent use. It is similar in spirit to JSON, which is based on
JavaScript, but Pond represents fewer data types directly.

KBounce is a single player arcade game with the elements of puzzle.
It is played on a field, surrounded by walls, with two or more balls
that move about in the field bouncing off of walls. The player can
build new walls, decreasing the size of the active field.
The goal of the game is to fill at least 75% of the field and
advance to the next level.

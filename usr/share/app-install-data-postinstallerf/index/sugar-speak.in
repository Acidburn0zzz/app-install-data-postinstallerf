Speak is a talking face for the XO laptop. Anything you type will be spoken
aloud using the XOs speech synthesizer, espeak. You can adjust the accent,
rate and pitch of the voice as well as the shape of the eyes and mouth. This
is a great way to experiment with the speech synthesizer, learn to type or
just have fun making a funny face for your XO.

Comment3='
MixinExtraFields provides a simple way to add an arbitrary number of stashes
for named data.  These data can be stored in the object, in a database, or
anywhere else.  The storage mechanism is abstracted away from the provided
interface, so one storage mechanism can be easily swapped for another.
Multiple ExtraFields stashes can be mixed into one class, using one or many
storage mechanisms.

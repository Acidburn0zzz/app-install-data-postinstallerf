Subversion is a concurrent version control system which enables one
or more users to collaborate in developing and maintaining a
hierarchy of files and directories while keeping a history of all
changes.  Subversion only stores the differences between versions,
instead of every complete file.  Subversion is intended to be a
compelling replacement for CVS.

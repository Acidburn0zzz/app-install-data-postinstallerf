The package extends the drawing capacities of the pict2e that
serves as a LaTeX 2e replacement for picture mode. In
particular, curve2e introduces new macros for lines and
vectors, new specifications for line terminations and joins,
arcs with any angular aperture, arcs with arrows at one or both
ends, generic curves specified with their nodes and the tangent
direction at these nodes.

Comment3='
The mingw64-libltdl package contains the GNU Libtool Dynamic Module Loader, a
library that provides a consistent, portable interface which simplifies the
process of using dynamic modules, for the mingw64 cross compilation
environment.

These runtime libraries are needed by programs that link directly to the
system-installed ltdl libraries; they are not needed by software built using
the rest of the GNU Autotools (including GNU Autoconf and GNU Automake).

Comment3='
OpenProps is a tiny Java library which reads and writes .properties files
using the same code as java.util.Properties from the OpenJDK, but enhanced so
that it preserves the order of entries within the file, and it also preserves
comments in the file.
This means that a Properties editor or a file converter written to use
OpenProps wont have to lose comments or mess up the order of entries.

By using OpenJDK code, OpenProps should handle all the old corner-cases in
exactly the same way Java does.  The handling of whitespace and comments is
tested by a number of JUnit tests.  But please let me know if you find a bug!

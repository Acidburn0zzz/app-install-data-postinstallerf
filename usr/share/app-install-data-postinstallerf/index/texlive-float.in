Comment3='
Improves the interface for defining floating objects such as
figures and tables. Introduces the boxed float, the ruled float
and the plaintop float. You can define your own floats and
improve the behaviour of the old ones. The package also
provides the H float modifier option of the obsolete here
package. You can select this as automatic default with
\floatplacement{figure}{H}.

Django Federated Login provides an authentication bridge between
Django projects and OpenID-enabled identity providers. The bridge is
pre-wired to be used with a single Google Apps domain, but could be
extended to be linked with other OpenID providers also. It is different
from other OpenID consumers as this consumer only allows connecting to
a pre-defined identity provider.

The provided backend matches users based on the e-mail address returned
from the identity provider. If no matching user could be found, a user
account can optionally be created.

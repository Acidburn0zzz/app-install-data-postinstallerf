This program makes PNG and/or GIF graphics from DVI files as
obtained from TeX and its relatives. Its benefits include -
Speed. It offers very fast rendering of DVI as bitmap files,
which makes it suitable for generating large amounts of images
on-the-fly, as needed in preview-latex, WeBWorK and others; -
It does not read the postamble, so it can be started before TeX
end-of-file for further output, unless it finds the POST marker
that indicates the end of the DVI; - Interactive query of
options. dvipng can read options interactively through stdin,

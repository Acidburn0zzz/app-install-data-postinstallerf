Comment3='
Xdialog is designed to be a drop in replacement for the cdialog program.
It converts any terminal based program into a program with an X-windows
interface. The dialogs are easier to see and use and Xdialog adds even
more functionalities (help button+box, treeview, editbox, file selector,
range box, and much more).

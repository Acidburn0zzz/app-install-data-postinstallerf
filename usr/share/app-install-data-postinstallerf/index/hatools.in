The HA-Tools provide some programs to improve shell scripting in a High
Availability environment.

The halockrun program provides a simple and reliable way to implement a locking
in shell scripts. A typical usage for halockrun is to prevent cronjobs to run
simultanously. halockrun uses a lock on a file via fcntl(2) which ensures the
release of the lock even if the process gets killed via SIGKILL.
The hatimerun program provides a time-out mechanism which can be used from
shell scripts.

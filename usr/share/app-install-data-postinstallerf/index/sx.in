sxconsole is a tool used to extract various report types and then
analyze those extracted reports with plug-ins. The tool also provides
an archiving structure so that all the compressed and extracted
reports are saved to a directory. This tool was developed for
sysreport/sosreports but has been expanded to include any report that
has a class defined.

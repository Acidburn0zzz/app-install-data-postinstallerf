Mozprocess provides Python process management via an operating system
and platform transparent interface to Mozilla platforms of interest.
Mozprocess aims to provide the ability to robustly terminate a process
(by timeout or otherwise), along with any child processes, on Windows,
OS X, and Linux. Mozprocess utilizes and extends `subprocess.Popen` to
these ends.

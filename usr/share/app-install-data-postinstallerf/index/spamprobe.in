Comment3='
A spam filter that takes a different approach from the typical
hand crafted rules based systems.  Instead of using pattern matching
and a set of human generated rules SpamProbe relies on a Bayesian
analysis of the frequency of words used in spam and non-spam emails
received by an individual person.  The process is completely automatic
and tailors itself to the kinds of emails that each person receives.
Spamprobe is not a mail filtering program itself but is designed to
plug into another mail filtering system like procmail or
Perl MailProcmail.

PHP Judy implements sparse dynamic arrays (aka Judy Arrays).
This extension is based on the Judy C library. A Judy array
consumes memory only when it is populated, yet can grow to
take advantage of all available memory if desired. Judys key
benefits are scalability, high performance, and memory efficiency.

Check is a unit test framework for C. It features a simple interface for
defining unit tests, putting little in the way of the developer. Tests
are run in a separate address space, so Check can catch both assertion
failures and code errors that cause segmentation faults or other signals.
The output from unit tests can be used within source code editors and IDEs.

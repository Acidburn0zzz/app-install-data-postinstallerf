Support for skipping the beginning of the file is implemented with the FTP REST
command, which starts a retrieval at any point in the file. Support for
skipping the end of the file is implemented with the FTP ABOR command, which
stops the transfer. With these two commands and some careful tracking of the
current file position, were able to reliably emulate a seek/read pair, and get
only the parts of the file that are actually read.

This was originally designed for use with ArchiveZip; its reliable enough
that the table of contents and individual files can be extracted from a remote
ZIP archive without downloading the whole thing.

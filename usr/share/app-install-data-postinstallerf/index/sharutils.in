The sharutils package contains the GNU shar utilities, a set of tools for
encoding and decoding packages of files (in binary or text format) in
a special plain text format called shell archives (shar).  This format can be
sent through e-mail (which can be problematic for regular binary files).  The
shar utility supports a wide range of capabilities (compressing, uuencoding,
splitting long files for multi-part mailings, providing check-sums), which
make it very flexible at creating shar files.  After the files have been sent,
the unshar tool scans mail messages looking for shar files.  Unshar
automatically strips off mail headers and introductory text and then unpacks
the shar files.

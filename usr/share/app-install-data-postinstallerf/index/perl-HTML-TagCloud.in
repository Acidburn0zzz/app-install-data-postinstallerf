The HTMLTagCloud module enables you to generate "tag clouds" in HTML. Tag
clouds serve as a textual way to visualize terms and topics that are used
most frequently. The tags are sorted alphabetically and a larger font is
used to indicate more frequent term usage.

This module provides a simple interface to generating a CSS-based HTML tag
cloud. You simply pass in a set of tags, their URL and their count.  This
module outputs style-sheet-based HTML.  You may use the included CSS or use
your own.

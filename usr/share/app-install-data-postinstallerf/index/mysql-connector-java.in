MySQL Connector/J is a native Java driver that converts JDBC (Java Database
Connectivity) calls into the network protocol used by the MySQL database.
It lets developers working with the Java programming language easily build
programs and applets that interact with MySQL and connect all corporate
data, even in a heterogeneous environment. MySQL Connector/J is a Type
IV JDBC driver and has a complete JDBC feature set that supports the
capabilities of MySQL.

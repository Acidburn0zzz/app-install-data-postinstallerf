Comment3='
The uw-imap package provides UW server daemons for both the IMAP (Internet
Message Access Protocol) and POP (Post Office Protocol) mail access
protocols.  The POP protocol uses a "post office" machine to collect
mail for users and allows users to download their mail to their local
machine for reading. The IMAP protocol allows a user to read mail on a
remote machine without downloading it to their local machine.

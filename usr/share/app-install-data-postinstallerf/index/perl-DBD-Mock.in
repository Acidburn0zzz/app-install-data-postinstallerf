Testing with databases can be tricky. If you are developing a system
married to a single database then you can make some assumptions about your
environment and ask the user to provide relevant connection information.
But if you need to test a framework that uses DBI, particularly a framework
that uses different types of persistence schemes, then it may be more
right SQL is generated and that the correct parameters are bound. DBDMock
makes it easy to just modify your configuration (presumably held outside
your code) and just use it instead of DBDFoo (like DBDPg or DBDmysql)
in your framework.

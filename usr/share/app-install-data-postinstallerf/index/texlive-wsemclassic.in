Comment='<span size="xx-large">LaTeX class for Bavarian school w-seminar papers</span>'
Comment3='
The class is designed either to conform with the
recommendations of the Bavarian Kultusministerium for
typesetting w-seminar papers (strict mode), or to use another
style which should look better. The class is based on the LaTeX
standard report class.

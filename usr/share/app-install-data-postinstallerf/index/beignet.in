Beignet is an open source implementation of the OpenCL specification - a generic
compute oriented API. This code base contains the code to run OpenCL programs
on Intel GPUs which basically defines and implements the OpenCL host functions
required to initialize the device, create the command queues, the kernels and
the programs and run them on the GPU.

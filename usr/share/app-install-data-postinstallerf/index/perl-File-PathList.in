Many systems that map generic relative paths to absolute paths do so with a
set of base paths. For example, perl itself when loading classes first turn
a "ClassName" into a path like "Class/Name.pm", and then looks through each
element of @INC to find the actual file. To aid in portability, all relative
paths are provided as UNIX-style relative paths, and converted to the
localized version in the process of looking up the path.

The PDF Renderer is just what the name implies an open source,
all Java library which renders PDF documents to the screen using
Java2D. Typically this means drawing into a Swing panel, but it
could also draw to other Graphics2D implementations. It could be
used to draw on top of PDFs, share them over a network, convert
PDFs to PNG images, or maybe even project PDFs into a 3D scene.

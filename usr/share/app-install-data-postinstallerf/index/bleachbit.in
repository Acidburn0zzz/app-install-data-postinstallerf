BleachBit deletes unnecessary files to free valuable disk space, maintain
privacy, and remove junk. Rid your system of old clutter including cache,
cookies, Internet history, localizations, logs, temporary files, and broken
shortcuts. It wipes clean the cache and history list of many common programs.

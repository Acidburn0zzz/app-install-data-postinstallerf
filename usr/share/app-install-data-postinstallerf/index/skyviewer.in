SkyViewer is an OpenGL based program to display HEALPix-based skymaps,
saved in FITS format files. The loaded skymaps can be viewed either on a 3D
sphere or as a Mollweide projection. In either case, realtime panning and
zooming are supported, along with rotations for the 3D sphere view,
assuming you have a strong enough graphics card.

CM-Super family of fonts are Adobe Type 1 fonts that replace
the T1/TS1-encoded Computer Modern (EC/TC), T1/TS1-encoded
Concrete, T1/TS1-encoded CM bright and LH fonts (thus
supporting all European languages except Greek, and all
Cyrillic-based languages), and bringing many ameliorations in
typesetting quality. The fonts exhibit the same metrics as the
MetaFont-encoded originals.

DejaGnu is an Expect/Tcl based framework for testing other programs.
DejaGnu has several purposes to make it easy to write tests for any
program; to allow you to write tests which will be portable to any
host or target where a program must be tested; and to standardize the
output format of all tests (making it easier to integrate the testing
into software development).

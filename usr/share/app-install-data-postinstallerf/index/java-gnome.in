These are the Java bindings for GTK and GNOME! Featuring a robust
engineering design, completely generated internals, a lovingly
crafted layer presenting the public API, and steadily increasing
coverage of the underlying libraries.

You can use java-gnome to develop sophisticated user interfaces
for Linux applications so that they richly integrate with the
GNOME Desktop while leveraging the power of the Java language
and your expertise with it.

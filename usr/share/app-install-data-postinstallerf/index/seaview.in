SeaView is a graphical multiple sequence alignment editor developed by Manolo
Gouy.  SeaView is able to read and write various alignment formats (NEXUS, MSF,
CLUSTAL, FASTA, PHYLIP, MASE).  It allows to manually edit the alignment, and
also to run DOT-PLOT or CLUSTALW/MUSCLE programs to locally improve the
alignment.

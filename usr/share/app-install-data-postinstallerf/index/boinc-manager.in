The BOINC Manager is a graphical monitor and control utility for the BOINC
core client. It gives a detailed overview of the state of the client it is
monitoring. The BOINC Manager has two modes of operation, the "Simple View" in
which it only displays the most important information and the "Advanced View"
in which all information and all control elements are available.

Comment3='
This module attempts to emulate the behavior of ClassAccessorFast
as accurately as possible using the Moose attribute system. The public
API of "ClassAccessorFast" is wholly supported, but the private
methods are not.  If you are only using the public methods (as you
should) migration should be a matter of switching your "use base" line
to a "with" line.

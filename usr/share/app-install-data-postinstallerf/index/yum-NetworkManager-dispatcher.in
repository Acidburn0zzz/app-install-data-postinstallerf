Comment3='
This NetworkManager "dispatch script" forces yum to check its cache if/when a
new network connection happens in NetworkManager. Note that currently there is
no checking of previous data, so if your WiFi keeps going up and down (or you
suspend/resume a lot) yum will recheck its cached data a lot.

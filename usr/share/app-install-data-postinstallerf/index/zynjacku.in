zynjacku is JACK based, GTK (2.x) host for LV2 synths. It has one JACK MIDI
input port (routed to all hosted synths) and one (two for stereo synths) JACK
audio output port per plugin. Such design provides multi-timbral sound by
running several synth plugins.

zynjacku is a nunchaku weapon for JACK audio synthesis. You have solid parts
for synthesis itself and you have flexible part that allows synthesis to suit
your needs.
lv2rack is a host for LV2 effect plugins.

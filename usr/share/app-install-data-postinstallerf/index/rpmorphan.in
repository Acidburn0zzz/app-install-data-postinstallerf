Comment3='
rpmorphan finds "orphaned"[1] packages on your system. It determines
which packages have no other packages depending on their installation,
and shows you a list of these packages.  It intends to be clone of
deborphan Debian tools for rpm packages.

It will try to help you to remove unused packages, for example
* after a distribution upgrade
* when you want to suppress packages after some tests
Several tools are also provided

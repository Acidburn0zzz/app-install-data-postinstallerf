The sysstat package contains sar, sadf, mpstat, iostat, pidstat, nfsiostat,
cifsiostat and sa tools for Linux.
The sar command collects and reports system activity information. This
information can be saved in a file in a binary format for future inspection. The
statistics reported by sar concern I/O transfer rates, paging activity,
process-related activities, interrupts, network activity, memory and swap space
utilization, CPU utilization, kernel activities and TTY statistics, among
others. Both UP and SMP machines are fully supported.
The sadf command may be used to display data collected by sar in various formats
(CSV, XML, etc.).

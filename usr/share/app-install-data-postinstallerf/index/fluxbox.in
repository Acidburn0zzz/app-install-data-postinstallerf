Fluxbox is yet another window-manager for X.  Its based on the Blackbox 0.61.1
code. Fluxbox looks like blackbox and handles styles, colors, window placement
and similar thing exactly like blackbox (100% theme/style compatibility).  So
whats the difference between fluxbox and blackbox then?  The answer is LOTS!

Have a look at the homepage for more info ;)

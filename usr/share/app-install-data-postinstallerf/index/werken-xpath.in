Comment3='
werken.xpath is an implementation of the W3C XPath Recommendation, on
top of the JDOM library.  It takes as input a XPath expression, and a
JDOM tree, and returns a NodeSet (java.util.List) of selected
elements.  Is is being used in the development of the
as-yet-unreleased werken.xslt (eXtensible Stylesheet Language) and the
werken.canonical (XML canonicalization) packages.

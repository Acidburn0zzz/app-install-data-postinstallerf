libyui can be used independently of YaST for generic (C++) applications
and has very few dependencies.

You do NOT need this package for developing with libyui. Use of
libyui-devel is sufficient for such purpose.
This package is only needed when you want to develop an extension for
libyui-ncurses which is not covered within the UI-plugin.

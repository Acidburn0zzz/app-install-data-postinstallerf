SEC is a simple event correlation tool that reads lines from files, named
pipes, or standard input, and matches the lines with regular expressions,
Perl subroutines, and other patterns for recognizing input events.
Events are then correlated according to the rules in configuration files,
producing output events by executing user-specified shell commands, by
writing messages to pipes or files, etc.

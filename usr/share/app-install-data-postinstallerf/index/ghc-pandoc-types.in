This package contains definitions for the Pandoc data structure, which
is used by pandoc to represent structured documents. These definitions
used to live in the pandoc package, but they have been split off, so
that other packages can use them without drawing in all of pandocs
dependencies, and pandoc itself can depend on packages (like
citeproc-hs) that use them.

Comment3='
The EventManager is a component designed for the following use cases

* Implementing simple subject/observer patterns.
* Implementing Aspect-Oriented designs.
* Implementing event-driven architectures.
The basic architecture allows you to attach and detach listeners to named
events, both on a per-instance basis as well as via shared collections;
trigger events; and interrupt execution of listeners.

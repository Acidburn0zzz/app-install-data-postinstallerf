netsniff-ng is a high performance Linux network sniffer for packet inspection.
It can be used for protocol analysis, reverse engineering or network
debugging. The gain of performance is reached by zero-copy mechanisms, so
that the kernel does not need to copy packets from kernelspace to userspace.

netsniff-ng toolkit currently consists of the following utilities
* netsniff-ng the zero-copy sniffer, pcap capturer and replayer itself.
* trafgen a high performance zero-copy network packet generator.
* ifpps a top-like kernel networking and system statistics tool.

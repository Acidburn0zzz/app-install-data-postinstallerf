Utrac is a command line tool and a library that recognize the encoding
of an input file (ex UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, CP437...) and its end-of-line
type (CR, LF, CRLF).
It has three main features
- Automatic recognition (depending on the file and on the systems locale),
  reliable in most cases;
- Assistance for verification or manual recognition;
- Conversion to an other charset and/or end-of-line type.

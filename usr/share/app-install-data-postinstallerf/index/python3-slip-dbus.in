Comment3='
The Simple Library for Python 3.x packages contain miscellaneous code for
convenience, extension and workaround purposes.

This package provides slip.dbus.service.Object, which is a dbus.service.Object
derivative that ends itself after a certain time without being used and/or if
there are no clients anymore on the message bus, as well as convenience
functions and decorators for integrating a dbus service with PolicyKit.

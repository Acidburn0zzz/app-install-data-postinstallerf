If you consult "perldoc -f require" you will see that "require" will behave
differently when given a bare-word or a string. In the case of a string,
"require" assumes you are wanting to load a file. But in the case of
a bare-word, it assumes you mean a module.

This gives nasty overhead when you are trying to dynamically require modules
at run-time, since you will need to change the module notation to a file
notation fitting the particular platform you are on.
"load" eliminates the need for this overhead and will just DWYM.

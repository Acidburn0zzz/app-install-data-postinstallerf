Alchemy is an open drawing project aimed at exploring how we can sketch, draw
and create on computers in new ways. Alchemy isn?t software for creating
finished artwork, but rather a sketching environment that focuses on the
absolute initial stage of the creation process. Experimental in nature,
Alchemy lets you brainstorm visually to explore an expanded range of ideas
and possibilities in a serendipitous way.

Comment3='
dc3dd is a patched version of GNU dd to include a number of features useful
for computer forensics. Many of these features were inspired by dcfldd, but
were rewritten for dc3dd.

    * Pattern writes. The program can write a single hexadecimal value or a
    text string to the output device for wiping purposes.
    * Piecewise and overall hashing with multiple algorithms and variable
    size windows. Supports MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512. Hashes can be
    computed before or after conversions are made.
    * Progress meter with automatic input/output file size probing

Kiriki is an addictive and fun dice game for KDE, designed to be played by as
many as six players. Participants have to collect points by rolling five dice
for up to three times per single turn. Each roll generates a specific
combination of numbers which the player is free to either accept or decline.
However, each specific combination of numbers can be accepted only once.
After thirteen turns the game ends and the scores are compared.
The player with the largest amount of points wins the game.

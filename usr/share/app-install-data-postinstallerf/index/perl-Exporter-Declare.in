ExporterDeclare is a meta-driven exporting tool. ExporterDeclare tries
to adopt all the good features of other exporting tools, while throwing
away horrible interfaces. ExporterDeclare also provides hooks that allow
you to add options and arguments for import. Finally, ExporterDeclares
meta-driven system allows for top-notch introspection.

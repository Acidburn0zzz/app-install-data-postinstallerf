Comment3='
Scout is an interface to Tomboy notes or Gnote that uses DBus to
communicate. It presents a command-line interface and tries to be
as simple to use as possible. Different actions can be taken to
interact with Tomboy or Gnote. Actions are simple to create,
making the application easily extensible.

Current actions make it possible to list note names,
display note contents, search for text inside notes and to
delete notes.

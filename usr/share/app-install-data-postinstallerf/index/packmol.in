Comment3='
Packmol creates an initial point for molecular dynamics simulations by
packing molecules in defined regions of space. The packing guarantees
that short range repulsive interactions do not disrupt the
simulations.

The great variety of types of spatial constraints that can be
attributed to the molecules, or atoms within the molecules, makes it
easy to create ordered systems, such as lamellar, spherical or tubular
lipid layers.

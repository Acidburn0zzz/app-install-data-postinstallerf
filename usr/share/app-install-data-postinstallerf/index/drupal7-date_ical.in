Comment3='
This module contains code to create an iCal feed in Views.
It has been pulled out of the Calendar iCal module because
it has no dependency on Calendar and
it could be used on any view.
The code has also been generalized so that
it will work for any entity, not just nodes.
It creates an iCal view mode for every entity type
that can be used to to configure the description
used in the iCal feed, and adds theme suggestions to
tell Drupal to look for an iCal version of the entity template.

PXP is a validating XML parser for OCaml. It represents the parsed
document either as tree or as stream of events. In tree mode, it is
possible to validate the XML document against a DTD.

The acronym PXP means Polymorphic XML Parser. This name reflects the
ability to create XML trees with polymorphic type parameters.

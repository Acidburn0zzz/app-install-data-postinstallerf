Stop chasing your music across different machines, services and
websites. Its time to take the work out of "play". If the song you want
to listen to is in your local library, it just plays. If the song is on
a remote machine, it just plays. If the song is on the web, or available
from your subscription service, it just plays. By abstracting a piece
of contents metadata from its file location, users can easily share
playlists, listening history and more. Its sort of like Wonka Vision,
Tomahawk will reassemble it on the other side. OK, maybe thats not a
good analogy... but its just as delicious.

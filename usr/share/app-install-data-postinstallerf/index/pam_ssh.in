Comment3='
This PAM module provides single sign-on behavior for UNIX using SSH keys.
Users are authenticated by decrypting their SSH private keys with the
password provided. In the first PAM login session phase, an ssh-agent
process is started and keys are added. The same agent is used for the
following PAM sessions. In any case the appropriate environment variables
are set in the session phase.

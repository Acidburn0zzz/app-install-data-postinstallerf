Comment3='
ANSI Common Lisp is a high-level, general-purpose programming
language.  GNU CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible
of Karlsruhe University and Michael Stoll of Munich University, both
in Germany.  It mostly supports the Lisp described in the ANSI Common
Lisp standard.  It runs on most Unix workstations (GNU/Linux, FreeBSD,
NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, Tru64, HP-UX, BeOS, NeXTstep, IRIX, AIX and
others) and on other systems (Windows NT/2000/XP, Windows 95/98/ME)
and needs only 4 MiB of RAM.

It is Free Software and may be distributed under the terms of GNU GPL,

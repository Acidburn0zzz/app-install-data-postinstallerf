Logcheck is a simple utility which is designed to allow a system administrator
to view the log-files which are produced upon hosts under their control.

It does this by mailing summaries of the log-files to them, after first
filtering out "normal" entries.
Normal entries are entries which match one of the many included regular
expression files contain in the database.

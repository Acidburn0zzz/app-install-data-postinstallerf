Comment3='
Low level client for Elasticsearch. Its goal is to provide common ground
for all Elasticsearch-related code in Python. The clients features include

- Translating basic Python data types to and from json
- Configurable automatic discovery of cluster nodes
- Persistent connections
- Load balancing (with pluggable selection strategy) across all available nodes
- Failed connection penalization (time based - failed connections wont be
  retried until a timeout is reached)
- Thread safety

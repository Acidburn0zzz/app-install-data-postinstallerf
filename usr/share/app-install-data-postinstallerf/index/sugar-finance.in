Finance is a simple financial planning activity. It can be integrated
into classroom assignments, or else used to track finances for a school
club. It might also be useful for students who wish to help their parents
with home finances.

The register view allows students to enter income and expenses, assign
categories, and review past transactions. The chart view shows students
a visual breakdown of their expenses by category. The budget view allows
users to assign a monthly budget to each category, and to see how each
months expenses compare to the budget.

Comment3='
Shakespeare is a family of type-safe, efficient template languages.
Shakespeare templates are expanded at compile-time,
ensuring that all interpolated variables are in scope.
Variables are interpolated according to their type through a typeclass.
Shakespeare templates can be used inline with a quasi-quoter
or in an external file.

See the documentation at <http//www.yesodweb.com/book/shakespearean-templates>
for more details.

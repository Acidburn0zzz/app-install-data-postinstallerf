This CDDA reader distribution (libcdio-cdparanoia) reads audio from the
CDROM directly as data, with no analog step between, and writes the
data to a file or pipe as .wav, .aifc or as raw 16 bit linear PCM.

Split off from libcdio to allow more flexible licensing and to be compatible
with cdparanoia-III-10.2s license. And also, libcdio is just too large.

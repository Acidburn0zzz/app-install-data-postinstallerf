This plugin adds "blocks" and "blocked by" fields to each ticket, enabling
you to express dependencies between tickets. It also provides a
graphviz-based dependency-graph feature for those tickets having
dependencies specified, allowing you to visually understand the
dependency tree. The dependency graph is viewable by clicking depgraph in
the context (in the upper right corner) menu when viewing a ticket that
blocks or is blocked by another ticket.

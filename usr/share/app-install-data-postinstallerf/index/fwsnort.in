fwsnort translates Snort rules into equivalent iptables rules and generates
a Bourne shell script that implements the resulting iptables commands.

In addition, fwsnort (optionally) uses the IPTablesParse module to parse the
iptables ruleset on the machine to determine which Snort rules are applicable
to the specific iptables policy.
fwsnort is able to translate approximately 60% of all rules from the
Snort-2.3.3 IDS into equivalent iptables rules.

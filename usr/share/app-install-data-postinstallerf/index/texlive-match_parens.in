Mismatches of parentheses, braces, (angle) brackets, especially
in TeX sources which may be rich in those, may be difficult to
trace. This little script helps you by writing your text to
standard output, after adding a left margin to your text, which
will normally be almost empty, but will clearly show any
mismatches.

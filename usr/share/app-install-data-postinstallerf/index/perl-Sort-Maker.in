Comment3='
This module has two main goals to make it easy to create correct sort
functions, and to make it simple to select the optimum sorting algorithm
for the number of items to be sorted. SortMaker generates complete sort
subroutines in one of four styles, plain, orcish manouver, Schwartzian
Transform and the Guttman-Rosler Transform. You can also get the source for
a sort sub you create via the sorter_source call.

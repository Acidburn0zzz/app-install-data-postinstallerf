The goal of the serp bytecode framework is to tap the full
power of bytecode modification while lowering its associated
costs. The framework provides a set of high-level APIs for
manipulating all aspects of bytecode, from large-scale
structures like class member fields to the individual
instructions that comprise the code of methods. While in
order to perform any advanced manipulation, some understanding
of the class file format and especially of the JVM instruction
set is necessary, the framework makes it as easy as possible
to enter the world of bytecode development.

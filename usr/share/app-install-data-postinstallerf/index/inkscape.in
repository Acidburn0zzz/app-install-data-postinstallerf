Inkscape is a vector graphics editor, with capabilities similar to
Illustrator, CorelDraw, or Xara X, using the W3C standard Scalable Vector
Graphics (SVG) file format.  It is therefore a very useful tool for web
designers and as an interchange format for desktop publishing.

Inkscape supports many advanced SVG features (markers, clones, alpha
blending, etc.) and great care is taken in designing a streamlined
interface. It is very easy to edit nodes, perform complex path operations,
trace bitmaps and much more.

The Read activity allows the laptop to act as a book reader. It has a
simple interface, and will view many kinds of text and image-based book-
like materials. It will have particular strengths in handheld mode, with
extremely low power consumption and simple navigation controls.

Read can read PDF files, single-page TIFF files, and also read DJVU files.

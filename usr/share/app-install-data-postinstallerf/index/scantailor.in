Scan Tailor is an interactive post-processing tool for scanned pages.
It performs operations such as page splitting, deskewing, adding/removing
borders, and others. You give it raw scans, and you get pages ready to be
printed or assembled into a PDF or DJVU file. Scanning, optical character
recognition, and assembling multi-page documents are out of scope of this
project.

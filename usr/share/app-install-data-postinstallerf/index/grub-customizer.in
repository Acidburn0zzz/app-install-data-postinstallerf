Grub Customizer is a graphical interface to configure the grub2/burg settings
with focus on the individual list order - without losing the dynamical behavior
of grub.

The goal of this project is to create a complete and intuitive graphical
grub2/burg configuration interface. The main feature is the boot entry list
configuration - but not simply by modified the grub.cfg to keep the dynamical
configuration, this application will only edit the script order and generate
proxies (script output filter), if required.

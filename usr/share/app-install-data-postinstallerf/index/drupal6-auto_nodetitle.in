This is a small and efficient module
that allows hiding of the content title field in the form.
To prevent empty content title fields one can configure it
to generate the title by a given pattern.
When the token module is installed
its possible to use various node data for the
auto generated title - e.g. use the text of a CCK field (since 5.x).
Advanced users can also provide some PHP code,
that is used for automatically generating an appropriate title.

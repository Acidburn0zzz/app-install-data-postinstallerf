Comment='<span size="xx-large">Python wrapper for the GNUTLS library</span>'
Comment3='
This package provides a high level object oriented wrapper around gnutls,
as well as low level bindings to the GNUTLS types and functions via ctypes.
The high level wrapper hides the details of accessing the GNUTLS library via
ctypes behind a set of classes that encapsulate GNUTLS sessions, certificates
and credentials and expose them to python applications using a simple API.

The package also includes a Twisted interface that has seamless intergration
with Twisted, providing connectTLS and listenTLS methods on the Twisted reactor
once imported (the methods are automatically attached to the reactor by simply
importing the GNUTLS Twisted interface module).

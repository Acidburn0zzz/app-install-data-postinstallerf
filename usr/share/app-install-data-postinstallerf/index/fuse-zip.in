fuse-zip is a FUSE file system to navigate, extract, create and modify
ZIP archives based in libzip implemented in C++.

With fuse-zip you really can work with ZIP archives as real directories.
Unlike KIO or Gnome VFS, it can be used in any application without
modifications.
Unlike other FUSE filesystems, only fuse-zip provides write support
to ZIP archives. Also, fuse-zip is faster that all known implementations
on large archives with many files.

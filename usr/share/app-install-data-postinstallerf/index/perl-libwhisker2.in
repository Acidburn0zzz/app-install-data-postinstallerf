Comment3='
Libwhisker is a Perl library useful for HTTP testing scripts.  It
contains a pure-Perl implementation of functionality found in the LWP,
URI, DigestMD5, DigestMD4, DataDumper, AuthenNTLM, HTMLParser,
HTMLFormParser, CGIUpload, MIMEBase64, and GetOptStd modules.
Libwhisker is designed to be portable (a single perl file), fast (general
benchmarks show libwhisker is faster than LWP), and flexible (great care
was taken to ensure the library does exactly what you want to do, even
if it means breaking the protocol).

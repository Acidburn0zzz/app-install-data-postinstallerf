The Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) consists of many state-of-the-art
sampling-based motion planning algorithms. OMPL itself does not contain
any code related to, e.g., collision checking or visualization. This is
a deliberate design choice, so that OMPL is not tied to a particular
collision checker or visualization front end.

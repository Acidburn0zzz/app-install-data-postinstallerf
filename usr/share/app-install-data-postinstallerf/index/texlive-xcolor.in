Provides easy driver-independent access to several kinds of
color tints, shades, tones, and mixes of arbitrary colors. It
allows a user to select a document-wide target color model and
offers complete tools for conversion between eight color
models. Additionally, there is a command for alternating row
colors plus repeated non-aligned material (like horizontal
lines) in tables. Colors can be mixed like
\color{red!30!green!40!blue}.

Comment3='
This module provides a C API, for XS modules, concerned with custom
parsing. It is centered around the function cv_set_call_parser, which allows
XS code to attach a magical annotation to a Perl subroutine, resulting in
resolvable calls to that subroutine having their arguments parsed by
arbitrary C code. (This is a more conveniently structured facility than the
cores PL_keyword_plugin API.) This module makes cv_set_call_parser and
several supporting functions available.

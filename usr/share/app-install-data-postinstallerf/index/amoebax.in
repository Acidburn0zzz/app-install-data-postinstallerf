Amoebax is a cute and addictive action-puzzle game. Due an awful mutation,
some amoebas species have started to multiply until they take the world if
you cant stop them. Fortunately the mutation made then too unstable and
lining up four or more will make them disappear.

Follow Kim or Tom through 6 levels in their quest to prevent the cute
multiplying amoebas to take the world and become the new Amoeba Master. Watch
out for the cute but amoebas controlled creatures that will try to put and
end to your quest.

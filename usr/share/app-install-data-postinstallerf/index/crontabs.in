This package is used by Fedora mainly for executing files by cron.

The crontabs package contains root crontab files and directories.
You will need to install cron daemon to run the jobs from the crontabs.
The cron daemon such as cronie or fcron checks the crontab files to
see when particular commands are scheduled to be executed.  If commands
are scheduled, it executes them.
Crontabs handles a basic system function, so it should be installed on
your system.

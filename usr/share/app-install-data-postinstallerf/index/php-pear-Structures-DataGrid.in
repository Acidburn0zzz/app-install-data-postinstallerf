This package offers a toolkit to render out a datagrid in HTML format as well
as many other formats such as an XML Document, an Excel Spreadsheet, an XUL
Document and more. It also offers paging and sorting functionality to limit
the data that is presented and processed. This concept is based on the .NET
Framework DataGrid control and works very well with database and XML result
sets.

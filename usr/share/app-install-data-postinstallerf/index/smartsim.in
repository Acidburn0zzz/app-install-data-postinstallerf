SmartSim is a free and open source digital logic circuit design and
simulation package.

SmartSim lets you create complex circuits by allowing you to create
your own custom components and including them in other circuits, as if
they were any other built-in component. These larger circuits can then
also be included in other designs as sub-components. SmartSim also
offers the ability to print out or export your circuit designs to PDF,
PNG, or SVG.

Lets begin the WAR of Mascots from UniX!
Theyll represent your favorite free software titles while battling it out
in the arena using dynamite, grenades, baseball bats and other bazookas...
Exterminate your opponent in a 2D environment with toon-style scenery.
Each player controls the team of his choice (penguin, gnu, firefox, wilber,...)
and must destroy his adversary using more or less casual weapons.
Although a minimum of strategy is required to vanquish, WarMUX is pre-eminently
a "convivial mass murder" game where, turn by turn, each member of each team.

The project was started as Wormux, and was renamed to Warmux in November 2010.

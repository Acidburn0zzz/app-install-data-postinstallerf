This module provides an API for users to gain or lose points for performing
certain actions on your site.

In conjunction with other modules, such as the Userpoints Nodes and Comments
(http//drupal.org/project/userpoints_nc) users can accumulate points for
actions such as posting nodes, commenting or moderation duties.
Use one of the many contributed modules
(http//drupal.org/project/userpoints_contrib) to extend the functionality of
the module to include point accumulation on page views or votes, upgrade roles

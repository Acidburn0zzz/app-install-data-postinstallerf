Comment3='
v4l2 is a control panel for video4linux2 devices, it reads a description of the
controls that the V4L2 device supports from the device, and presents the user
with a graphical means for adjusting those controls. It allows for controlling
multiple devices. Controls can be updated with the device status either
manually, or periodically and there is an easy way to reset one or all the
controls to their default state.

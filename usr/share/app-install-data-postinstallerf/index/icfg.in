Comment3='
This is a utility for manipulating SysV network interface configuration files
(the files matching the glob /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/icfg-*).  These are
text based files, that are normally easily edited by hand, but in many
environments hand editing is not desirable (for instance, during kickstart
installations).  Icfg creates a scriptable interface to allow an admin to
provision a systems network interfaces during install, without having to fall
back to using a series of sed and awk commands

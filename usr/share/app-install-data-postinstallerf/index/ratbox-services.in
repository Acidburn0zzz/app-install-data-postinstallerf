ratbox-services is a services package written mostly from
scratch for use with ircd-ratbox. It is highly configurable,
with nearly all options being set in a config that can be
rehashed rather than set at compile time. It also uses the
SQLite database backend, which works as a database interface
to a normal file, meaning no separate database software must be running.

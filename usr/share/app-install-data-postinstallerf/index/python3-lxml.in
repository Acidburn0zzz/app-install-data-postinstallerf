Comment3='
lxml provides a Python 3 binding to the libxslt and libxml2 libraries.
It follows the ElementTree API as much as possible in order to provide
a more Pythonic interface to libxml2 and libxslt than the default
bindings.  In particular, lxml deals with Python 3 Unicode strings
rather than encoded UTF-8 and handles memory management automatically,
unlike the default bindings.

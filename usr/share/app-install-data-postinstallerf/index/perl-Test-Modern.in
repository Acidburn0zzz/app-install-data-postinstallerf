Comment3='
TestModern provides the best features of TestMore, TestFatal,
TestWarnings, TestAPI, TestLongString, and TestDeep, as well as ideas
from TestRequires, TestDescribeMe, TestMoose, and TestCleanNamespaces.

TestModern also automatically imposes strict and warnings on your script,
and loads IOFile (much of the same stuff ModernPerl does).

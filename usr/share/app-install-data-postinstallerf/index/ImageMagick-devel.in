Comment3='
ImageMagick-devel contains the library links and header files youll
need to develop ImageMagick applications. ImageMagick is an image
manipulation program.

If you want to create applications that will use ImageMagick code or
APIs, you need to install ImageMagick-devel as well as ImageMagick.
You do not need to install it if you just want to use ImageMagick,
however.

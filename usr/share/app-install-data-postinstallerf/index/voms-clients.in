In grid computing, and whenever the access to resources may be controlled
by parties external to the resource provider, users may be grouped to
Virtual Organizations (VOs). This package provides a VO Membership Service
(VOMS), which informs on that association between users and their VOs
groups, roles and capabilities.

This package provides command line applications to access the VOMS
services.

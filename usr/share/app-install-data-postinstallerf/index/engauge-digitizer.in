This open source, digitizing software converts an image file
showing a graph or map, into numbers.
The image file can come from a scanner, digital camera
or screen-shot. The numbers can be read on the screen,
and written or copied to a spreadsheet.
The process starts with an image file containing a graph or map.
The final result is digitized data that can be used by other tools
such as Gnumeric.

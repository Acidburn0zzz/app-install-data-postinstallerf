HTTPie is a CLI HTTP utility built out of frustration with existing tools. The
goal is to make CLI interaction with HTTP-based services as human-friendly as
possible.

HTTPie does so by providing an http command that allows for issuing arbitrary
HTTP requests using a simple and natural syntax and displaying colorized
responses.

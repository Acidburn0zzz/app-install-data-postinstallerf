UADE plays old Amiga tunes through UAE emulation and a cloned m68k-assembler
Eagleplayer API. The player infrastructure of UADE is built on the ground work
of the Eagleplayer and DeliTracker projects. UADE makes these external players
reusable on certain UNIX and other platforms. UADE contains a free
(as in freedom) implementation of Eagleplayer and DeliTracker API for UNIX
variants.

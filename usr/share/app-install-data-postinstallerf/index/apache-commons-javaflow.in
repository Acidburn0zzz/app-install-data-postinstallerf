variables and the program counter, and save them into an object. If
this object would give us the ability to restart the processing from
the point stored in it.
A continuation is exactly the type of object that we need. Think of a
continuation as an object that, for a given point in your program,
contains a snapshot of the stack trace, including all the local
variables, and the program counter. You can not only store these
things in the continuation object, but also restore the execution

The fonts were originally distributed as MetaFont sources only,
but Adobe Type 1 versions are also now available. Macro support
is provided for use under LaTeX; the package supports the
"only" option (provided by the somedefs package) to restrict
what is loaded, for those who dont need the whole font.

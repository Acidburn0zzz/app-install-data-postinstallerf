Comment3='
simcrs aims at providing a clean API and a simple implementation, as
a C++ library, of a Travel-oriented Distribution System. It
corresponds to the simulated version of the real-world Computerized
Reservation Systems (CRS). That library uses the Standard Airline IT
C++ object model (http//sf.net/projects/stdair).

simcrs makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for
increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular the
Boost (C++ Standard Extensions http//www.boost.org) library is used.

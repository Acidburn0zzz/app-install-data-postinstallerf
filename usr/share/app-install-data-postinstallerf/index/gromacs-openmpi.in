GROMACS is a versatile and extremely well optimized package to perform
molecular dynamics computer simulations and subsequent trajectory analysis.
It is developed for biomolecules like proteins, but the extremely high
performance means it is used also in several other field like polymer chemistry
and solid state physics.

mdrun has been compiled with thread parallellization (for running on
a single node) and with Open MPI (for running on multiple nodes).
This package single and double precision binaries and libraries.

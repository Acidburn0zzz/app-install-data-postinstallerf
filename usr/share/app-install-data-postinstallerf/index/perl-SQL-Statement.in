Comment3='
The SQLStatement module implements a pure Perl SQL parsing and execution
engine.  While it by no means implements full ANSI standard, it does support
many features including column and table aliases, built-in and user-defined
functions, implicit and explicit joins, complexly nested search conditions, and
other features.

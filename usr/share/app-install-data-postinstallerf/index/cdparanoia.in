Cdparanoia (Paranoia III) reads digital audio directly from a CD, then
writes the data to a file or pipe in WAV, AIFC or raw 16 bit linear
PCM format.  Cdparanoia doesnt contain any extra features (like the ones
included in the cdda2wav sampling utility).  Instead, cdparanoias strength
lies in its ability to handle a variety of hardware, including inexpensive
drives prone to misalignment, frame jitter and loss of streaming during
atomic reads.  Cdparanoia is also good at reading and repairing data from
damaged CDs.

Comment3='
ProxyTunnel is a program that connects stdin and stdout to a server somewhere
on the network, through a standard HTTPS proxy. We mostly use it to tunnel SSH
sessions through HTTP(S) proxies.
Proxytunnel can currently do the following
    * Create tunnels using HTTP and HTTPS proxies (That understand the HTTP
      CONNECT command).
    * Work as a back-end driver for an OpenSSH client, and create SSH
      connections through HTTP(S) proxies.
    * Work as a stand-alone application, listening on a port for connections,
      and then tunneling these connections to a specified destination.

The Network Information Service (NIS) is a system which provides
network information (login names, passwords, home directories, group
information) to all of the machines on a network.  NIS can enable
users to login on any machine on the network, as long as the machine
has the NIS client programs running and the users password is
recorded in the NIS passwd database.  NIS was formerly known as Sun
Yellow Pages (YP).

This packages NIS implementation is based on FreeBSDs YP and is a
special port for glibc 2.x and libc versions 5.4.21 and later.  This

Ptrash moves the named file(s) to the ~/.trash directory. Trash is located
under the home directory of a user. It is a simple console based utility,
I wrote after deleting some files, which I couldnt retrieve back.
Ptrash can also restore file(s) back to there original location. It has really
proved very handy to me.

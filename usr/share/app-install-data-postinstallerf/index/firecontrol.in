FireControl, the IEEE 1394 Commander, is a console oriented tool for Linux
to access an IEEE 1394 (FireWire) bus. It can issue asynchronous read, write
and lock requests to some nodes on the bus, force bus resets, and send PHY
packets. Furthermore, it provides bus reset notifications. The main advantage
of this tool over other available tools (like gscanbus) is (besides not
requiring a graphical interface) that it reports the exact acknowledge and
response codes and, therefore, is very useful for debugging purposes.

The Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit (MRPT) is an extensive, cross-platform,
and open source C++ library aimed to help robotics researchers to design and
implement algorithms in the fields of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM), computer vision, and motion planning (obstacle avoidance).

This package provides a set of console and GUI applications for manipulating
datasets, particle filtering localization and SLAM, grabbing data from
robotic sensors, etc.

Freeciv is a turn-based, multi-player, X based strategy game. Freeciv
is generally comparable to, and has compatible rules with, the
Civilization II(R) game by Microprose(R). In Freeciv, each player is
the leader of a civilization, and is competing with the other players
in order to become the leader of the greatest civilization.

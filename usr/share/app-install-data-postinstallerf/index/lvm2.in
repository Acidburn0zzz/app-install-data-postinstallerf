LVM2 includes all of the support for handling read/write operations on
physical volumes (hard disks, RAID-Systems, magneto optical, etc.,
multiple devices (MD), see mdadd(8) or even loop devices, see
losetup(8)), creating volume groups (kind of virtual disks) from one
or more physical volumes and creating one or more logical volumes
(kind of logical partitions) in volume groups.

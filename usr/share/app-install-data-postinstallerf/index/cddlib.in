The C-library cddlib is a C implementation of the Double Description
Method of Motzkin et al. for generating all vertices (i.e. extreme points)
and extreme rays of a general convex polyhedron in R^d given by a system
of linear inequalities

   P = { x=(x1, ..., xd)^T   b - A  x  >= 0 }
where A is a given m x d real matrix, b is a given m-vector
and 0 is the m-vector of all zeros.
The program can be used for the reverse operation (i.e. convex hull

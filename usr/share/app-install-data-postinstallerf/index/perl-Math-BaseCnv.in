BaseCnv provides a few simple functions for converting between arbitrary
number bases. It is as fast as I currently know how to make it (of course
relying only on the lovely Perl). If you would rather utilize an object syntax
for number-base conversion, please see Ken Williamss
<Ken@Forum.Swarthmore.Edu> fine MathBaseCalc module.

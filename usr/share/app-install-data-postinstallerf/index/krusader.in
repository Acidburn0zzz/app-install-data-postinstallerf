Krusader is an advanced twin panel (commander style) file manager for KDE and
other desktops in the *nix world, similar to Midnight or Total Commander.
It provides all the file management features you could possibly want.
Plus extensive archive handling, mounted filesystem support, FTP, advanced
search module, an internal viewer/editor, directory synchronisation,
file content comparisons, powerful batch renaming and much much more.
It supports a wide variety of archive formats and can handle other KIO slaves
such as smb or fish. It is (almost) completely customizable, very user
friendly, fast and looks great on your desktop! You should give it a try.

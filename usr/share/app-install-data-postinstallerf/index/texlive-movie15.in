Provides an interface to embed movies, sounds and 3D objects
into PDF documents for use with LaTeX as well as pdfLaTeX.
Defines \includemovie with PDF-1.5 compatibility. Option
autoplay causes the media clip to be started right after the
page has loaded. This is useful for side by side movie clips to
be played back synchronously.

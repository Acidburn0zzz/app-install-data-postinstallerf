The TNC@FHH project is an open source implementation of the Trusted Network
Connect (TNC) framework, which is specified by the Trusted Computing Group
(TCG). TNC@FHH allows you to provision access to a network based upon
factors like the user credentials and the requesting endpoints integrity state.

The following TNC components and their respective interfaces are implemented by
TNC@FHH IMCs (IF-IMC 1.2), IMVs (IF-IMV 1.2), TNCS (IF-TNCCS 1.1),
NAA (IF-T EAP 1.1).

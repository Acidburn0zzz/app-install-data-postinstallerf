Aprsdigi is a specialized Amateur Packet Radio (AX.25) UI-frame digipeater
for the Automatic Position Reporting System, APRS(tm).

Aprsmon collects and displays standard AX.25 UI text frames in a format similar
to that output by a standard TNC in "Monitor ON" mode and is intended
to be used with programs like javAPRS which wish to see a TNC data
stream over a TCP connection.

Comment3='
Lazy attributes are computed attributes that are evaluated only once, the first
time they are used.  Subsequent uses return the results of the first call. They
come handy when code should run

- *late*, i.e. just before it is needed, and
- *once*, i.e. not twice, in the lifetime of an object.
You can think of it as deferred initialization.
The possibilities are endless.

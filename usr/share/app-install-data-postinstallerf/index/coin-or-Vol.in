Vol (Volume Algorithm) is an open-source implementation of a subgradient
method that produces primal as well as dual solutions. The primal solution
comes from estimating the volumes below the faces of the dual problem. This
is an approximate method so the primal vector might have small infeasiblities
that are negligible in many practical settings. The original subgradient
algorithm produces only dual solutions.

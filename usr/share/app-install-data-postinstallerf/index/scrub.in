Scrub writes patterns on files or disk devices to make
retrieving the data more difficult.  It operates in one of three
modes 1) the special file corresponding to an entire disk is scrubbed
and all data on it is destroyed;  2) a regular file is scrubbed and
only the data in the file (and optionally its name in the directory
entry) is destroyed; or 3) a regular file is created, expanded until
the file system is full, then scrubbed as in 2).

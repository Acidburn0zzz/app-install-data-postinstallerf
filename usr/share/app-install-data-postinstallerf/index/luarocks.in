LuaRocks allows you to install Lua modules as self-contained packages
called "rocks", which also contain version dependency
information. This information is used both during installation, so
that when one rock is requested all rocks it depends on are installed
as well, and at run time, so that when a module is required, the
correct version is loaded. LuaRocks supports both local and remote
repositories, and multiple local rocks trees.

luckyBackup is an application that backs-up and/or synchronizes any
directories with the power of rsync.

It is simple to use, fast (transfers over only changes made and not all data),
safe (keeps your data safe by checking all declared directories before
proceeding in any data manipulation ), reliable and fully customizable.

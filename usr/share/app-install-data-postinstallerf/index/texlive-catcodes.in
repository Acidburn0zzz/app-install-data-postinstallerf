The bundle deals with category code switching; the packages of
the bundle should work with any TeX format (with the support of
the plainpkg package). The bundle provides - stacklet.sty,
which supports stacks that control the use of different
catcodes; - actcodes.sty, which deals with active characters;
and - catchdq.sty, which provides a simple quotation character
control mechanism.

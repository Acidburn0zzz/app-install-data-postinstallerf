ipcalculator takes an IP address and netmask and calculates the resulting
broadcast, network, Cisco wildcard mask, and host range. By giving a second
netmask, you can design subnets and supernets. It is also intended to be
a teaching tool and presents the subnetting results as easy-to-understand
binary values.

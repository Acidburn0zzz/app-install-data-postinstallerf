Impressive is a program that displays presentation slides. But unlike
OpenOffice.org Impress or other similar applications, it does so with
style.

Smooth alpha-blended slide transitions are provided for the sake
of eye candy, but in addition to this, Impressive offers some unique tools
that are really useful for presentations.

DustMite is a tool which minimizes D source code. It was inspired by Tigris
Delta and a thread on digitalmars.D.learn.
DustMite will parse the source code into a simple hierarchy, and attempt to
shrink it by deleting fragments iteratively, as long as the result satisfies
a user-specified condition.

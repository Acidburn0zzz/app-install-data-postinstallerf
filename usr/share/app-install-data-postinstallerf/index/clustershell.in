Tools and event-based Python library to execute commands on cluster nodes in
parallel depending on selected engine and worker mechanisms. The library
provides also advanced NodeSet and NodeGroups handling methods to ease and
improve administration of large compute clusters or server farms. Three
convenient command line utilities, clush, clubak and nodeset, allow traditional
shell scripts to benefit some useful features offered by the library.

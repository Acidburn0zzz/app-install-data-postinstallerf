Comment3='
Shorewall6 Lite is a companion product to Shorewall6 (the IPV6
firewall) that allows network administrators to centralize the
configuration of Shorewall-based firewalls. Shorewall Lite runs a
firewall script generated by a machine with a Shorewall rule
compiler. A machine running Shorewall Lite does not need to have a
Shorewall rule compiler installed.

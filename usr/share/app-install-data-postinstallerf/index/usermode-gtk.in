The usermode-gtk package contains several graphical tools for users
userinfo, usermount and userpasswd.  Userinfo allows users to change
their finger information.  Usermount lets users mount, unmount, and
format file systems.  Userpasswd allows users to change their
passwords.

Install the usermode-gtk package if you would like to provide users with
graphical tools for certain account management tasks.

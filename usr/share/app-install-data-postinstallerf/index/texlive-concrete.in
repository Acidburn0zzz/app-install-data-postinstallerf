Concrete Roman fonts, designed by Donald E. Knuth, originally
for use with Euler mathematics fonts. Alternative mathematics
fonts, based on the concrete parameter set are available as
the concmath fonts bundle. LaTeX support is offered by the
beton, concmath and ccfonts packages. T1- and TS1-encoded
versions of the fonts are available in the ecc bundle, and
Adobe Type 1 versions of the ecc fonts are part of the cm-super
bundle.

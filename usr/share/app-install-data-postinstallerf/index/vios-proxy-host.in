Comment3='
The vios-proxy-host daemon runs on a QEMU host. A vios-proxy-host daemon
manages all the proxy connections for a single proxy service on the host.
Multiple vios-proxy-host daemons are required to provide proxy access to
multiple services on the host. A single vios-proxy-host daemon may open
multiple proxy channels to multiple QEMU guests limited only by the
number of virtioserial connections available to each guest.

dieharder is a fairly involved random number/uniform deviate generator
tester.  It can either test any of its many pre-built and linked
generators (basically all of those in the Gnu Scientific Library plus
some others) or a potentially random data-set in a file.  With file
input, it can manage either a variety of ASCII-formatted input or a raw
binary bit string.  It is thus suitable for use in testing both software
RNGs and hardware RNGs.

dieharder does all of its work with a standalone, extensible library,
libdieharder. Therefore its tests can be integrated into other programs.

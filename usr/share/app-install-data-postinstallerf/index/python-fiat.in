The FInite element Automatic Tabulator FIAT supports generation of
arbitrary order instances of the Lagrange elements on lines, triangles,
and tetrahedra.
It is also capable of generating arbitrary order instances of Jacobi-
type quadrature rules on the same element shapes. Upcoming versions
will also support Hermite and nonconforming elements as well as H(div)
and H(curl) elements such as Raviart-Thomas and Nedelec are supported
on triangles and tetrahedra.

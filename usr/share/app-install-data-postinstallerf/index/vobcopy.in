Vobcopy copies DVD .vob files to disk, decrypting them on the way (thanks to
libdvdread and libdvdcss) and merges them into file(s) with the name extracted
from the DVD. There is one drawback though at the moment vobcopy doesnt deal
with multi-angle-dvds. But since these are rather sparse this shouldnt
matter much.

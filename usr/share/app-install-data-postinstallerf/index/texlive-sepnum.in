Provides a command to print a number with (potentially
different) separators every three digits in the parts either
side of the decimal point (the point itself is also
configurable). The macro is fully expandable and not fragile
(unless one of the separators is). There is also a command
\sepnumform, that may be used when defining \the<counter>
macros.

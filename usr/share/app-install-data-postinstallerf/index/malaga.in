A software package for the development and application of
grammars that are used for the analysis of words and sentences of natural
languages. It is a language-independent system that offers a programming
language for the modelling of the language-dependent grammatical
information. This language is also called Malaga.

Malaga is based on the grammatical theory of the "Left Associative Grammar"
(LAG), developed by Roland Hausser, professor for Computational Linguistics at
University of Erlangen, Germany.

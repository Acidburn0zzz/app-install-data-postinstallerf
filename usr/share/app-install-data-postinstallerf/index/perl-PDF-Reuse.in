This module allows you to reuse PDF-files. You can use pages, images,
fonts and Acrobat JavaScript from old PDF-files (if they were not
encrypted), and rearrange the components, and add new graphics, texts etc.

There is also support for graphics. In the tutorial there is a description of
how to transform simple PDF-pages to graphic Perl objects with the help of
programs based on this module.
The module is fairly fast, so it should be possible to use it for mass
production.

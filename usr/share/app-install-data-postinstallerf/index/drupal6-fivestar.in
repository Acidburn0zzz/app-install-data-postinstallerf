The Fivestar voting module adds a clean, attractive voting widget to nodes and
comments and any entity. It features
* jQuery rollover effects and AJAX no-reload voting
* Configurable star sets
* Graceful degradation to an HTML rating form when JavaScript is turned off
* Support for anonymous voters
* Spam protection to keep users from filling your DB with bogus votes
* Easy-to-use integration with Views module for lists sorted by rating, or
      filtered by min/max ratings
* A Fivestar CCK field for use in custom node types

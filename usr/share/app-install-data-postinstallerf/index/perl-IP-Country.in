IPCountry allows fast lookups of IP addresses and their corresponding
countries based on available regional NIC data.
Although the country of assignment will probably be the country associated
with a large ISP rather than the client herself, this is probably good
enough for most log analysis applications, and under test has proved to be as
accurate as reverse-DNS and WHOIS lookup.

The netpbm-progs package contains a group of scripts for manipulating the
graphics files in formats which are supported by the netpbm libraries.  For
example, netpbm-progs includes the rasttopnm script, which will convert a
Sun rasterfile into a portable anymap.  Netpbm-progs contains many other
scripts for converting from one graphics file format to another.

If you need to use these conversion scripts, you should install
netpbm-progs.  Youll also need to install the netpbm package.

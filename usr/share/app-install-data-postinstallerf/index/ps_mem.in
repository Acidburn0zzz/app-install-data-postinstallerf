The ps_mem tool can determine how much RAM is used per program
(not per process). In detail it reports
sum(private RAM for program processes) + sum(Shared RAM for program processes)
The shared RAM is problematic to calculate, and the tool automatically
selects the most accurate method available for the running kernel.

This font was created by Peter Schwanemann and originally based on a hand drawn
font created for a Pen & Paper RPG. Nowadays the font gets more and more
complete and should give the possibility of creating fantasy and/or decorative
logos, headings and other texts.  The font was not created to be used in body
texts, as it is too complex and not as easy to read as a simple sans serif
font.

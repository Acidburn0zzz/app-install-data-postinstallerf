Inception is a FireWire physical memory manipulation and hacking tool
exploiting IEEE 1394 SBP-2 DMA. The tool can unlock (any password accepted)
and escalate privileges to Administrator/root on almost any machine you have
physical access to.

Inception aims to provide a stable and easy way of performing intrusive and
non-intrusive memory hacks on live computers using FireWire SBP-2 DMA. It is
primarily intended to do its magic against computers that utilize full disk
encryption such as BitLocker, FileVault, TrueCrypt or Pointsec.

py-radix is an implementation of a radix tree for Python, which
supports storage and lookups of IPv4 and IPv6 networks.

The radix tree (a.k.a Patricia tree) is the data structure most
commonly used for routing table lookups. It efficiently stores
network prefixes of varying lengths and allows fast lookups of
containing networks. py-radixs implementation is built solely
for networks (the data structure itself is more general).

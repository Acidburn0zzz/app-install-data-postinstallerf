Ghemical is a computational chemistry application.  Ghemical is
written in C++. It has a graphical user interface (in fact, a couple
of them), and it supports both quantum-mechanics (semi-empirical and
ab initio) models and molecular mechanics models (there is an
experimental Tripos 5.2-like force field for organic molecules). Also
a tool for reduced protein models is included. Geometry optimization,
molecular dynamics and a large set of visualization tools are
currently available.

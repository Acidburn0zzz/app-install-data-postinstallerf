Comment3='
The gif2png program converts files from the obsolescent Graphic Interchange
Format to Portable Network Graphics. The conversion preserves all graphic
information, including transparency, perfectly. The gif2png program can
even recover data from corrupted GIFs.

There exists a web2png program in a separate package which is able
to convert entire directory hierarchies.

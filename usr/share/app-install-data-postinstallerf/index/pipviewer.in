Pipviewer is a visualizer for multiple alignements of genomic
sequences. It highlights conserved regions and allows basic
anotations. Its main goal is to find conserved probes for the
construction of gene order data sets.  Selected regions marked as
probes can be expoxted to fasta format. It can also retreive gene
annotations form the NBCI and display this information along the
alignement.

Pipviewer is not an aligner. You must compute the alignment with
another tool like Clustal or Multi PIP Maker.

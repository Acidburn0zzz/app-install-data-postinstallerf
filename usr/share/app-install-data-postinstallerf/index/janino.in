Janino is a super-small, super-fast Java compiler. Not only can it compile
a set of source files to a set of class files like the JAVAC tool, but also
can it compile a Java expression, block, class body or source file in
memory, load the bytecode and execute it directly in the same JVM. Janino
is not intended to be a development tool, but an embedded compiler for
run-time compilation purposes, e.g. expression evaluators or "server pages"
engines like JSP.

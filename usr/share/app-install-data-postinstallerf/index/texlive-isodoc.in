The isodoc class can be used for the preparation of letters and
invoices (and, in the future, similar documents). Documents are
set up with options, thus making the class easily adaptable to
users wishes and extensible for other document types. The
class is based on the NTG brief class by Victor Eijkhout, which
implements the NEN1026 standard.

The TrueType core fonts for the web that was once available from
http//www.microsoft.com/typography/fontpack/. The src rpm is cleverly
constructed so that the actual fonts are downloaded from Sourceforges site
at build time. Therefore this package technically does not redistribute
the fonts, it just makes it easy to install them on a linux system.

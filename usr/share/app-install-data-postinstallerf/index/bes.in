Comment3='
BES is a new, high-performance back-end server software framework for
OPeNDAP that allows data providers more flexibility in providing end
users views of their data. The current OPeNDAP data objects (DAS, DDS,
and DataDDS) are still supported, but now data providers can add new data
views, provide new functionality, and new features to their end users
through the BES modular design. Providers can add new data handlers, new
data objects/views, the ability to define views with constraints and
aggregation, the ability to add reporting mechanisms, initialization
hooks, and more.

Comment3='
This package defines new symbols for a number of functions, operators and types
in the base package. All symbols are documented with their actual definition
and information regarding their Unicode code point. They should be completely
interchangeable with their definitions.

For more Unicode goodness you can enable the UnicodeSyntax language extension.
This extension enables Unicode characters to be used to stand for certain ASCII
character sequences, i.e. ? instead of ->, ? instead of forall and many others.

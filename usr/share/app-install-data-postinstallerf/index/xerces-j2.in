Welcome to the future! Xerces2 is the next generation of high performance,
fully compliant XML parsers in the Apache Xerces family. This new version of
Xerces introduces the Xerces Native Interface (XNI), a complete framework for
building parser components and configurations that is extremely modular and
easy to program.

The Apache Xerces2 parser is the reference implementation of XNI but other
parser components, configurations, and parsers can be written using the Xerces
Native Interface. For complete design and implementation documents, refer to
the XNI Manual.

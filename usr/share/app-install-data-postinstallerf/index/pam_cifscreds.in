Comment3='
The pam_cifscreds PAM module is a tool for automatically adding
credentials (username and password) for the purpose of establishing
sessions in multiuser mounts.

When a cifs filesystem is mounted with the "multiuser" option, and does
not use krb5 authentication, it needs to be able to get the credentials
for each user from somewhere. The pam_cifscreds module can be used to
provide these credentials to the kernel automatically at login.

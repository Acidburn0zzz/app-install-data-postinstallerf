Comment3='
RdRand is an instruction for returning random numbers from an Intel on-chip
hardware random number generator.RdRand is available in Ivy Bridge and later
processors.

It uses cascade construction, combining a HW RNG operating at 3Gbps with CSPRNG
with all components sealed on CPU. The entropy source is a meta-stable circuit,
with unpredictable behavior based on thermal noise. The entropy is fed into
a 31 compression ratio entropy extractor (whitener) based on AES-CBC-MAC.
Online statistical tests are performed at this stage and only high quality
random data are used as the seed for cryptograhically secure SP800-90 AES-CTR

Comment3='
Tool for managing and executing tasks related to software releases and
system administration via customizable YAML scripts. A library of
prewritten tasks is built in so you can get started immediately.

Taboot uses Func for inter-system communication, eliminating hacky ssh
commands and the overhead associated with key management. Taboot can
be extended by writing your Func modules and tasks in Python.

ath_info prints some version information of Atheros WLAN modules. It
furthermore allows to change regulatory domain and PCI ID fields in the EEPROM.
Since the output of lspci and dmesg is not always sufficient to correctly
identify chipset versions, it is useful to attach ath_info output to bug
reports for the ath5k driver.

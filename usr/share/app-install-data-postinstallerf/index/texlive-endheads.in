Endheads provides running headers of the form "Notes to pp. xx-
yy" for endnotes sections. It also enables one to reset the
endnotes counter, and put a line marking the chapter change in
the endnotes, at the beginning of every chapter. Endheads
requires the fancyhdr, needspace, ifthen, and endnotes
packages.

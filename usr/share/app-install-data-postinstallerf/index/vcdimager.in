VCDImager allows you to create VideoCD BIN/CUE CD images from MPEG
files. These can be burned with cdrdao or any other program capable of
burning BIN/CUE files.

Also included is VCDRip which does the reverse operation, that is to
rip MPEG streams from images or burned VideoCDs and to show
information about a VideoCD.

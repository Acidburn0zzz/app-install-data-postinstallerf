Comment3='
Mikmatch (with a k) is the OCaml >= 3.10 version of Micmatch, an
extension for adding pattern matching with regular expressions to the
language.

The goal of Micmatch/Mikmatch is to make text-oriented programs even
easier to write, read and run without losing the unique and powerful
features of Objective Caml (OCaml).
Micmatch/Mikmatch provides a concise and highly readable syntax for
regular expressions, and integrates it into the syntax of OCaml thanks

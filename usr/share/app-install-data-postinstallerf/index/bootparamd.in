The bootparamd process provides bootparamd, a server process which
provides the information needed by diskless clients in order for them
to successfully boot.  Bootparamd looks first in /etc/bootparams for an
entry for that particular client; if a local bootparams file doesnt
exist, it looks at the appropriate Network Information Service (NIS)
map.  Some network boot loaders (notably Suns) rely on special boot
server code on the server, in addition to the RARP and TFTP servers.
This bootparamd server process is compatible with SunOS bootparam clients
and servers which need that boot server code.

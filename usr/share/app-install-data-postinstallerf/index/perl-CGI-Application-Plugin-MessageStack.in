This plugin gives you a few support methods that you can call within your
cgiapp to pass along messages between requests for a given user.

Its recommended that you use this in conjunction with
CGIApplicationPluginSession. You can opt to not have the messages
persist and thereby, not use CAP-Session by using an option in the
capms_config method.

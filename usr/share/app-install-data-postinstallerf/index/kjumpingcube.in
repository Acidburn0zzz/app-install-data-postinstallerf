KJumpingCube is a simple tactical game. You can play it against the computer
or a friend. The playing area consists of squares containing points. When the
game starts each square has only one point, and no owner. Players move by
clicking on either a vacant square or one of their own squares, thus
increasing the square?s point value by one. When a square?s value reaches
a maximum, the excess points are distributed around the neighboring squares,
taking over ownership of them. The winner is the player who ends up owning
all the squares.

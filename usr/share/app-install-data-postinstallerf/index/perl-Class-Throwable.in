Comment3='
This module implements a minimal lightweight exception object. It is
meant to be a compromise between more basic solutions like Carp which
can only print information and cannot handle exception objects, and more
complex solutions like ExceptionClass which can be used to define
complex inline exceptions and has a number of module dependencies.

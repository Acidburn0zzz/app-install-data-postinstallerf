dnssec-trigger reconfigures the local unbound DNS server. This unbound DNS
server performs DNSSEC validation, but dnssec-trigger will signal it to
use the DHCP obtained forwarders if possible, and fallback to doing its
own AUTH queries if that fails, and if that fails prompt the user via
dnssec-trigger-applet the option to go with insecure DNS only.

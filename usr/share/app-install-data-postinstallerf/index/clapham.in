Clapham is an open-source railroad diagram generator.
Railroad diagrams are a graphical way of representing the grammar of a
computer language. When a computer language is large, even people who
use the language day-to-day have trouble remembering its nuances. A
railroad diagram represents the grammar visually, and is easier to
understand by non- or semi-technical users.

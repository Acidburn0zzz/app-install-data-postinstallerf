Enca is an Extremely Naive Charset Analyser. It detects character set and
encoding of text files and can also convert them to other encodings using
either a built-in converter or external libraries and tools like libiconv,
librecode, or cstocs.

Currently, it has support for Belarussian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech,
Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Slovene, Ukrainian,
Chinese and some multibyte encodings (mostly variants of Unicode)
independent on the language.

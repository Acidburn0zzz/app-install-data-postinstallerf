Canna provides a user interface for inputting Japanese characters.
Canna supports Nemacs (Mule), kinput2, and canuum. All of these tools
can then use a single customization file, Romaji-to-Kana conversion
rules and dictionaries, and input Japanese in the same way. Canna
automatically supports Kana-to-Kanji conversions; the conversions are
based on a client-server model.

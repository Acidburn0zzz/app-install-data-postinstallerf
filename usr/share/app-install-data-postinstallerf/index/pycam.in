Comment3='
PyCAM is a toolpath generator for 3-axis CNC machining. It loads 3D
models in STL format or 2D contour models from DXF or SVG files. The
resulting GCode can be used with EMC2 or any other machine controller.

PyCAM supports a wide range of toolpath strategies for 3D models and
2D contour models.

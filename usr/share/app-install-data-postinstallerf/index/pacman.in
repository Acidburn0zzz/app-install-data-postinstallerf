Comment3='
Pacman is the package manager used by the Arch distribution. It is a
frontend for the ALPM (Arch Linux Package Management) library.

Pacman does not strive to "do everything." It will add, remove and
upgrade packages in the system, and it will allow you to query the
package database for installed packages, files and owners. It also
attempts to handle dependencies automatically and can download
packages from a remote server. Arch packages are simple archives, with
.pkg.tar.gz extension for binary packages and .src.tar.gz for source
packages.

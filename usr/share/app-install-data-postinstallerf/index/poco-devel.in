The POCO C++ Libraries (POCO stands for POrtable COmponents)
are open source C++ class libraries that simplify and accelerate the
development of network-centric, portable applications in C++. The
POCO C++ Libraries are built strictly on standard ANSI/ISO C++,
including the standard library.

This package contains the header files needed for developing
POCO applications.

Comment3='
This module was written to ensure that a META.yml file, provided with a
standard distribution uploaded to CPAN, meets the specifications that are
slowly being introduced to module uploads, via the use of ExtUtilsMakeMaker,
ModuleBuild and ModuleInstall.

See CPANMeta for further details of the CPAN Meta Specification.

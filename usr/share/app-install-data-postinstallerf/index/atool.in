atool is a script for managing file archives of various types.

It includes aunpack (to extract archives), apack (to create archives),
als (to list files), acat (to extract files to the standard output),
etc.
atool relies on external programs to handle the archives.
It determines the archive types using file extensions whenever possible,
with a fallback on file.

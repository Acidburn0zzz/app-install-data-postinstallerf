mwcls is a set of document classes for LaTeX 2e designed with
Polish typographical tradition in mind. Classes include
mwart (which is a replacement for article), mwrep
(report), and mwbk (book). Most features present in
standard classes work with mwcls. Some extensions/exceptions
include sectioning commands allow for second optional argument
(its possible to state different texts for running head and
for TOC), new environments itemize* and enumerate* for
lists with long items, page styles have variants for normal,
opening, closing, and blank pages.

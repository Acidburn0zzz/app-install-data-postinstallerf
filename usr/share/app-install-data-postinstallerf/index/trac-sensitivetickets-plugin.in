Comment3='
SensitiveTickets is a plugin that lets users mark tickets as "sensitive"
with a checkbox on the ticket form. Sensitive tickets are viewable only
to those with the SENSITIVE_VIEW permission.

Beware Hooks that send mail on ticket changes will still send mail for
sensitive tickets; this may not be what you want.
Beware if the plugin is removed, disabled, or fails to load, trac will
opt to display sensitive tickets ("failing open" instead of "failing closed").

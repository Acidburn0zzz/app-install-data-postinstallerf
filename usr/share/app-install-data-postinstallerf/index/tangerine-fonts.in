Tangerine is a calligraphy font inspired by many italic chancery hands from
the 16-17th century. Its tall ascender, the most distinct characteristic of
this type, takes a wide line space between lines and gives it a graceful
texture. It is generally advisable to use Tangerine for a title or short text
at large size because of the short height of lowercase letters. Tangerine is
produced by Japanese type designer Toshi Omagari and was named after a woman
who encouraged him to begin this work.

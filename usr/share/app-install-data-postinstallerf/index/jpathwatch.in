jpatchwatch is a Java library for monitoring directories
for changes. It uses the host platform?s native OS functions
to achieve this to avoid polling.

The following events on a directory can be monitored
  - File creation and deletion
  - File modification
  - File renaming
  - Changes in subdirectories (recursive monitoring)

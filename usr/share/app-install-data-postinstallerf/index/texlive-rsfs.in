Comment3='
The fonts provide uppercase formal script letters for use as
symbols in scientific and mathematical typesetting (in contrast
to the informal script fonts such as that used for the
calligraphic symbols in the TeX maths symbol font). The fonts
are provided as MetaFont source, and as derived Adobe Type 1
format. LaTeX support, for using these fonts in mathematics, is
available via one of the packages calrsfs and mathrsfs.

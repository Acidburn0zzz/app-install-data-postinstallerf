The RoboCup Soccer Simulator Server (rcssserver) is a research and educational
tool for mutli-agent systems and artificial intelligence. It allows 11
simulated autonomous robotic players to play soccer (football).

This package includes the simulation server. If you want to view the games
you should install and run a monitor (rcssmonitor or rcssmonitor_classic).

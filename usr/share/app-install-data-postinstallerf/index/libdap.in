Comment3='
The libdap++ library contains an implementation of DAP2. This package
contains the library, dap-config, and getdap. The script dap-config
simplifies using the library in other projects. The getdap utility is a
simple command-line tool to read from DAP2 servers. It is built using the
library and demonstrates simple uses of it.

Search and Rescue II is a rescue helicopter simulator for Linux. It features
several missions in which the player pilots a helicopter in order to rescue
people in distress. There are several scenarios and helicopter models.

Search and Rescue II has a strong focus on realistic physics and low graphics
requirements. It is a fork of the game "Search and Rescue"
(http//searchandrescue.sf.net), originally developed by Wolfpack
Entertainment.

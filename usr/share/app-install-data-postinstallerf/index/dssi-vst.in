dssi-vst is an adapter that allows users of Linux audio software to take VST
and VSTi audio effects and instrument plug-ins compiled for Windows, and load
them into native LADSPA or DSSI plug-in hosts. Plug-ins run at full speed for
most audio processing, although their user interfaces are slower because of the
Windows emulation.

This package contains the DSSI host for the plug-ins.

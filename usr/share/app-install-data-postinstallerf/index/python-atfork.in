While mixing threads and forking in a program is generally considered to be a
bad idea it need not be so painful.
A missing API in the Python is an atfork mechanism so that locks can be
acquired and released properly around fork calls.  This module adds that.  It
also provides monkey patchers that fix the standard library to properly

Byobu is a Japanese term for decorative, multi-panel screens that serve
as folding room dividers. As an open source project, Byobu is an
elegant enhancement of the otherwise functional, plain,
practical GNU Screen. Byobu includes an enhanced profile
and configuration utilities for the GNU screen window manager,
such as toggle-able system status notifications.

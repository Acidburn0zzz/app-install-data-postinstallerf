Resynthesizer is a Gimp plug-in for texture synthesis. Given a sample of a
texture, it can create more of that texture. This has uses including
- Creating more of a texture (including creation of tileable textures)
- Removing objects from images (great for touching up photos)
- Creating themed images (by transfering a texture from one image to another)

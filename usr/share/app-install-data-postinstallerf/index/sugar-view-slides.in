The View Slides activity is meant to allow the XO laptop to read
view the contents of a Zip file containing images named sequentially.
Project Gutenberg has a few books as raw scanned images, and this can
be a useful format for picture books, comic books, magazine articles,
photo essays, etc.

The interface to View Slides is similar to the core Read activity,
which should not be surprising as the toolbar code was adapted from
Reads toolbar. You can use the up and down arrows or the game
controller to move from page to page.

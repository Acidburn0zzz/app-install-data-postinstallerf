AcpiTool is a Linux ACPI client. Its a small command line application,
intended to be a replacement for the apm tool. Besides "basic" ACPI
information like battery status, AC presence, putting the laptop to
sleep, Acpitool also supports various extensions for Toshiba, Asus and
IBM Thinkpad laptops, allowing you to change the LCD brightness level,
toggle fan on/off, and more.

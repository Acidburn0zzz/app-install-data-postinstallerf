As of carto 0.2.0, the Carto module expects all data sources and
resources to be localized - remote references like URLs and providers
are not downloaded when maps are rendered.

Millstone now contains this logic - it provides two functions, resolve
and flush. Resolve takes an MML file and returns a localized version, and
flush can be used to clear the cache of a specific resource.

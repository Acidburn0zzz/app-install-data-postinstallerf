The X Display Manager Control Protocol (XDMCP) provides a uniform
mechanism for an autonomous display to request login service from a
remote host. By autonomous, we mean the display consists of hardware
and processes that are independent of any particular host where login
service is desired. An X terminal (screen, keyboard, mouse,
processor, network interface) is a prime example of an autonomous
display.

Linphone is mostly sip compliant. It works successfully with these
implementations
    * eStara softphone (commercial software for windows)
    * Pingtel phones (with DNS enabled and VLAN QOS support disabled).
    * Hotsip, a free of charge phone for Windows.
    * Vocal, an open source SIP stack from Vovida that includes a SIP proxy
        that works with linphone since version 0.7.1.
    * Siproxd is a free sip proxy being developed by Thomas Ries because he
        would like to have linphone working behind his firewall. Siproxd is
        simple to setup and works perfectly with linphone.

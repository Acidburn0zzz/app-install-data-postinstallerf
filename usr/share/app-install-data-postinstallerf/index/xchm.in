xCHM is a wxWidgets-based .chm viewer. xCHM can show the contents tree if
one is available, print the displayed page, change fonts faces and size,
work with bookmarks, do the usual history stunts (forward, back, home),
provide a searchable index and seach for text in the whole book. The
search is a fast B-tree search, based on the internal $FIftiMain file
found inside indexed .chm archives, and it can be customized to search in
content or just the topics titles.

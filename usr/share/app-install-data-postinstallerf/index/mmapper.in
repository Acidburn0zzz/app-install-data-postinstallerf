MMapper is a graphical mapper for a MUD named MUME (Multi-Users in Middle
Earth). The game is traditionally played in a text-only mode, but MMapper tries
to represent the virtual world in user-friendly graphical environment. It acts
as a proxy between a telnet client and a MUD server, being able to analyze game
data in real time and show players position in a map.

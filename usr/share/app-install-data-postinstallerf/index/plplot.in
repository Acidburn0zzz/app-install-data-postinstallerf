PLplot is a library of functions that are useful for making scientific
plots.

PLplot can be used from within compiled languages such as C, C++,
FORTRAN and Java, and interactively from interpreted languages such as
Octave, Python, Perl and Tcl.
The PLplot library can be used to create standard x-y plots, semilog
plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D surface plots, mesh plots, bar
charts and pie charts. Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)

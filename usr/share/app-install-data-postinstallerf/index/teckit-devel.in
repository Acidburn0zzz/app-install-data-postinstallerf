TECkit is a low-level toolkit intended to be used by other
applications that need to perform encoding conversions (e.g., when
importing legacy data into a Unicode-based application). The
primary component of the TECkit package is therefore a library that
performs conversions; this is the "TECkit engine". The engine
relies on mapping tables in a specific binary format (for which
documentation is available); there is a compiler that creates such
tables from a human-readable mapping description (a simple text file).

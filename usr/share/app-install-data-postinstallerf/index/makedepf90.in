Comment3='
Makedepf90 is a program for automatic creation of Makefile dependency
lists for Fortran source code. Makedepf90 supports MODULEs, INCLUDEs,
cpp #includes, f90ppr $includes and coco ??includes and set-files.

The original idea was to provide the same functionality for Fortran as
    gcc -MM *.c
does for C.

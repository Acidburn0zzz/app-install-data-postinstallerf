Tofrodos is a text file conversion utility that converts ASCII and Unicode
UTF-8 files between the MSDOS (or Windows) format, which traditionally have
CR/LF (carriage return/line feed) pairs as their new line delimiters, and
the Unix format, which usually have LFs (line feeds) to terminate each line.

It is a useful utility to have around when you have to convert files between
MSDOS (or Windows) and Unix/Linux/BSD (and her clones and variants). It comes
standard with a number of systems and is often found on the system as "todos",
"fromdos", "dos2unix" and "unix2dos".

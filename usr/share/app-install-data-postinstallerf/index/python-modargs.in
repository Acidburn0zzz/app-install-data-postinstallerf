This project is a simple command line argument parser that tries to
do as much as it can dynamically so that you dont have to specify
options and arguments with tons of code, and instead just write a
couple of modules with specially formatted functions.  It does this
with magic, by inspecting the modules you tell it to load and looking
for the right functions.

upslug2 is a command line program intended to allow the upgrade of a LinkSys
NSLU2 firmware to new or different versions.  Unlike upslug and the LinkSys
(Sercomm) upgrade utilities, upslug2 will synthesise a complete image
from a kernel and a root file system, as such it duplicates part of the
functionality of slugimage.

upslug2 also optimizes the upload to avoid transmitted parts of the image which
need not be written or are blank (set to the erased flash value of all 1s).

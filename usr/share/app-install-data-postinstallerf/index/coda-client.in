This package contains the main client program, the cachemanager Venus.
Also included are the binaries for the cfs, utilities for logging, ACL
manipulation etc, the hoarding tools for use with laptops and repair
tools for fixing conflicts. Finally there is the cmon and codacon
console utilities to monitor Codas activities. You need a Coda
kernel-module for your kernel version, or Coda in your kernel, to have
a complete coda client.

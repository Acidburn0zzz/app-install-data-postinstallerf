Comment3='
Project genmsg exists in order to decouple code generation from .msg & .srv
format files from the parsing of these files and from implementation details
of the build system (project directory layout, existence or nonexistence of
utilities like rospack, values of environment variables such as
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH) i.e. none of these are required to be set in any
particular way.

Comment3='
The OPeNDAP Lightweight Frontend Servlet (OLFS) provides the public-
accessible client interface for Hyrax.  The OLFS communicates with the Back
End Server (BES) to provide data and catalog services to clients.  The OLFS
implements the DAP2 protocol and supports some of the new DAP4 features.  We
hope that other groups will develop new front end modules that will implement
other protocols.

Graphite consists of a storage backend and a web-based visualization frontend.
Client applications send streams of numeric time-series data to the Graphite
backend (called carbon), where it gets stored in fixed-size database files
similar in design to RRD. The web frontend provides user interfaces
for visualizing this data in graphs as well as a simple URL-based API for
direct graph generation.

Graphites design is focused on providing simple interfaces (both to users and
applications), real-time visualization, high-availability, and enterprise
scalability.

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) offers a better solution to many
problems than do existing technologies, such as EJB.  AOP Alliance
intends to facilitate and standardize the use of AOP to enhance
existing middleware environments (such as J2EE), or development
environements (e.g. Eclipse).  The AOP Alliance also aims to ensure
interoperability between Java/J2EE AOP implementations to build a
larger AOP community.

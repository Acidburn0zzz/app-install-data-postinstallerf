The localization server is a set of Drupal modules powering
http//localize.drupal.org/, https//translate.openatrium.com/,
http//localize.openpublishapp.com/ and even the non-Drupal based
http//translate.musescore.org/ among other translation communities.

It provides a generic translation database back-end with a community
localization user interface, which allows people to collaborate on
translating projects to different languages. It currently contains
tools to translate Drupal projects as well as general Gettext based
sources.

A comprehensive, modular and portable cryptographic toolkit that provides
developers with a vast array of well known published block ciphers, one-way hash
functions, chaining modes, pseudo-random number generators, public key
cryptography and a plethora of other routines.

Designed from the ground up to be very simple to use. It has a modular and
standard API that allows new ciphers, hashes and PRNGs to be added or removed
without change to the overall end application. It features easy to use functions
and a complete user manual which has many source snippet examples.

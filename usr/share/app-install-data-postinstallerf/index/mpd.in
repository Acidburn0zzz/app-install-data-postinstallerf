Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a flexible, powerful, server-side application for
playing music. Through plugins and libraries it can play a variety of sound
files (e.g., OGG, MP3, FLAC, AAC, WAV) and can be controlled remotely via its
network protocol. It can be used as a desktop music player, but is also great
for streaming music to a stereo system over a local network. There are many
GUI and command-line applications to choose from that act as a front-end for
browsing and playing your MPD music collection.

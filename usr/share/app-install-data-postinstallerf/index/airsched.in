Comment3='
airsched aims at providing a clean API and a simple implementation, as
a C++ library, of an Airline Schedule Management System. It is intended
to be used in simulated environments only it is not designed to work
in the real-world of Airline IT operations.

airsched makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for
increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular the
Boost (C++ Standard Extensions http//www.boost.org) library is used.
Install the airsched package if you need a library of basic C++ objects

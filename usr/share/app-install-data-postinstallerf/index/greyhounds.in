Greyhounds is a greyhound racing and breeding game. Your goal is to
acquire fast and talented greyhounds and be successful with them in the
races; your two possibilities for doing so are breeding and trading.
Ultimately you should aim at winning the Champions Trophy. You might
also consider establishing a record that lasts to the end of times a
worthy goal.

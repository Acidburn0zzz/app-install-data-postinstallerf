The goal of the m2ec project is to provide a first-class Apache Maven support
in the Eclipse IDE, making it easier to edit Mavens pom.xml, run a build from
the IDE and much more. For Java developers, the very tight integration with JDT
greatly simplifies the consumption of Java artifacts either being hosted on open
source repositories such as Maven Central, or in your in-house Maven repository.

m2e is also a platform that let others provide better integration with
additional Maven plugins (e.g. Android, web development, etc.), and facilitates
the distribution of those extensions through the m2e marketplace.

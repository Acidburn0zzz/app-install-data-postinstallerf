Kronolith is the Horde calendar application. It provides web-based
calendars backed by a SQL database or a Kolab server. Supported features
include Ajax and mobile interfaces, shared calendars, remote calendars,
invitation management (iCalendar/iTip), free/busy management, resource
management, alarms, recurring events, and a sophisticated day/week view
which handles arbitrary numbers of overlapping events.

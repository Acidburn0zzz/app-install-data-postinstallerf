Comment3='
nose extends the test loading and running features of unittest, making
it easier to write, find and run tests.

By default, nose will run tests in files or directories under the
current working directory whose names include "test" or "Test" at a
word boundary (like "test_this" or "functional_test" or "TestClass"
but not "libtest"). Test output is similar to that of unittest, but
also includes captured stdout output from failing tests, for easy
print-style debugging.

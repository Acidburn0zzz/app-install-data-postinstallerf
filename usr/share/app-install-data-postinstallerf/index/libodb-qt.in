Comment3='
ODB is an object-relational mapping (ORM) system for C++. It provides
tools, APIs, and library support that allow you to persist C++ objects
to a relational database (RDBMS) without having to deal with tables,
columns, or SQL and without manually writing any of the mapping code.

This package contains the Qt profile library. The Qt profile provides
support for persisting Qt smart pointers, containers, and value types
with the ODB system.

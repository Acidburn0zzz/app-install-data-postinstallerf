DokuWiki is a standards compliant, simple to use Wiki, mainly aimed at creating
documentation of any kind. It has a simple but powerful syntax which makes sure
the datafiles remain readable outside the Wiki and eases the creation of
structured texts.

All data is stored in plain text files no database is required.

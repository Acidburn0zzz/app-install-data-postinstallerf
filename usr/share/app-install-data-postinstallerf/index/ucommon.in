GNU uCommon C++ is a lightweight library to facilitate using C++ design
patterns even for very deeply embedded applications, such as for systems using
uClibc along with POSIX threading support. For this reason, uCommon disables
language features that consume memory or introduce runtime overhead. UCommon
introduces some design patterns from Objective-C, such as reference counted
objects, memory pools, and smart pointers. UCommon introduces some new concepts
for handling of thread locking and synchronization.  Starting with release
5.0, GNU uCommon also bundles GNU Common C++ libraries.

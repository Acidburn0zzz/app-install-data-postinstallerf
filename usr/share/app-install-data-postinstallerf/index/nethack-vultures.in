Comment3='
Vultures Eye is a mouse-driven interface for NetHack that enhances
the visuals, audio and accessibility of the game, yet retains all the
original gameplay and game features.  Vultures Eye is based on
Falcons Eye, but is greatly extended.  Also included is Vultures
Claw, which is based on the SlashEm core.

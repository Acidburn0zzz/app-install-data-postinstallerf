Xfig is an X Window System tool for creating basic vector graphics,
including bezier curves, lines, rulers and more.  The resulting
graphics can be saved, printed on PostScript printers or converted to
a variety of other formats (e.g., X11 bitmaps, Encapsulated
PostScript, LaTeX).

You should install xfig if you need a simple program to create vector
graphics.

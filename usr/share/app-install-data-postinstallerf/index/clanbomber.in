ClanBomber is a free multiplayer game, using ClanLib, where the "purpose"
is to Blast the other players of the gamefield by laying bombs close to them.
While at the same time you must avoid being blown up yourself. It
is fully playable and features Computer controlled bombers, however, it is
recommended to play ClanBomber with friends (3-8 players are really fun).

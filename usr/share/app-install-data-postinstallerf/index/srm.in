srm is a secure replacement for rm(1). Unlike the standard rm, it
overwrites the data in the target files before unlinkg them. This
prevents command-line recovery of the data by examining the raw block
device. It may also help frustrate physical examination of the disk,
although its unlikely that completely protects against this type of
recovery.

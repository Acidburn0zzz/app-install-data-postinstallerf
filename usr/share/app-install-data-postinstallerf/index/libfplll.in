fplll contains several algorithms on lattices that rely on
floating-point computations. This includes implementations of the
floating-point LLL reduction algorithm, offering different
speed/guarantees ratios. It contains a wrapper choosing the
estimated best sequence of variants in order to provide a guaranteed
output as fast as possible. In the case of the wrapper, the
succession of variants is oblivious to the user. It also includes
a rigorous floating-point implementation of the Kannan-Fincke-Pohst
algorithm that finds a shortest non-zero lattice vector, and the BKZ
reduction algorithm.

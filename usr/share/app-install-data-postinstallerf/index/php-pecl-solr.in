Comment3='
Feature-rich library that allows PHP developers to communicate easily and
efficiently with Apache Solr server instances using an object-oriented API.

It effectively simplifies the process of interacting with Apache Solr using
PHP5 and it already comes with built-in readiness for the latest features
added in Solr 3.1. The extension has features such as built-in,
serializable query string builder objects which effectively simplifies the
manipulation of name-value pair request parameters across repeated requests.
The response from the Solr server is also automatically parsed into native php
objects whose properties can be accessed as array keys or object properties

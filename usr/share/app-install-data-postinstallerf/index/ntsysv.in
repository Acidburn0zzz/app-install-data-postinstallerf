Ntsysv provides a simple interface for setting which system services
are started or stopped in various runlevels (instead of directly
manipulating the numerous symbolic links in /etc/rc.d). Unless you
specify a runlevel or runlevels on the command line (see the man
page), ntsysv configures the current runlevel (5 if youre using X).

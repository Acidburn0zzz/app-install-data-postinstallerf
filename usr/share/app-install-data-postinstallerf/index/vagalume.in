Vagalume is a GTK+-based Last.fm client. Although it works on standard
PCs, it is specially designed to work in the Maemo platform, the one
used by some Nokia devices such as the 770, N800, N810 and N900.

Its main features are
    * It plays Last.fm radio streams (using the v2.0 API)
    * It supports Libre.fm and other compatible servers
    * Support for different radio stations (personal, neighbours, loved tracks,
       ..., or any lastfm// URL)

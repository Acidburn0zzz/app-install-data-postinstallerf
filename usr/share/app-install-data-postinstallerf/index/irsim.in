IRSIM is a tool for simulating digital circuits. It is a "switch-level"
simulator; that is, it treats transistors as ideal switches. Extracted
capacitance and lumped resistance values are used to make the switch a little
bit more realistic than the ideal, using the RC time constants to predict the
relative timing of events.

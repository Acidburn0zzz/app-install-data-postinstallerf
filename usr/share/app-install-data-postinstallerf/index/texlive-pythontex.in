The package allows you to enter Python code within a LaTeX
document, execute the code, and access its output in the
original document. Python code is only executed when it has
been modified, or when it meets user-specified criteria. Code
may be divided into user-defined sessions, which automatically
run in parallel. Errors and warnings are synchronized with the
LaTeX document, so that they refer to the documents line
numbers. External dependencies can be tracked, so that code is
re-executed when the data it depends on is modified. PythonTeX
also provides syntax highlighting for code in LaTeX documents

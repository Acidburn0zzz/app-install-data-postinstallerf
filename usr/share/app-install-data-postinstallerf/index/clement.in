Clement is an email firewall. Its purpose is to filter all email,
rejecting viruses and unwelcome messages at the SMTP protocol level
(and avoids bouncing to forged originators).

Clement extracts "email sending contexts" and can use a remote mentor
process to further analyze message context while still connected to the
remote sender process.

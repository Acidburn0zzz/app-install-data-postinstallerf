Comment3='
pyxtrlock, like its predecessor xtrlock, is a very minimal X display lock
program. While pyxtrlock is running, it does not obscure the screen, only the
mouse and keyboard are grabbed and the mouse cursor becomes a padlock. Output
displayed by X programs, and windows put up by new X clients, continue to be
visible, and any new output is displayed normally.

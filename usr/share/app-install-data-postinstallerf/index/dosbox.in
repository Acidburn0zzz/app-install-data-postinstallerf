DOSBox is a DOS-emulator using SDL for easy portability to different
platforms. DOSBox has already been ported to several different platforms,
such as Windows, BeOS, Linux, Mac OS X...
DOSBox emulates a 286/386 realmode CPU, Directory FileSystem/XMS/EMS,
a SoundBlaster card for excellent sound compatibility with older games...
You can "re-live" the good old days with the help of DOSBox, it can run plenty
of the old classics that dont run on your new computer!

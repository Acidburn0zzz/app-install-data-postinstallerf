Comment3='
VDR plugin to handle XBMC clients. It is needed to use XBMC as a frontend and
VDR as a backend. With the plugin it is possible to get TV and PVR
functionality from a VDR into a XBMC. It is able to handle several XBMC
clients connecting via the VNSI add-on.

In XBMC you need the PVR add-on "xbmc-pvr-vdr-vnsi" to connect XBMC
with a VDR running this plugin.
See http//wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=VDR for more information.

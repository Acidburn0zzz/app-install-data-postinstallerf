This framework provides a lighter version of TestUnit framework. It
implements some of the TestUnit classes and methods needed to run test
units. TestUnitLite tries to be compatible with public API of
TestUnit. It doesnt implement all classes and methods at 100% and only
those necessary to run tests are available.

Carp 1.25 made a change to its formatting, adding a period at the end of the
message. This can mess up tests and code that are looking for error messages.
CarpFix1_25 makes the message consistent, regardless of what version of
Carp youre using.

CarpFix1_25 exports its own carp functions, which change the Carp message
to match the 1.25 version. CarpFix1_25 otherwise acts exactly like Carp and
it will honor Carp global variables such as @CARP_NOT and %CarpInternal.
Why do this instead of just upgrading Carp? Upgrading Carp would affect all

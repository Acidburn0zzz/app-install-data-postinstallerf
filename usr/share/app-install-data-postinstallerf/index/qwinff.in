QWinFF is a cross-platform, easy-to-use media converter frontend to FFmpeg.
FFmpeg is a powerful command-line utility to convert audio and video file
into numerous formats. QWinFF features a rich set of presets to help users
use FFmpeg easily without having to manually input command-line flags.
Average users can convert multiple media files in just a few clicks,
while advanced users can still adjust conversion parameters in detail.

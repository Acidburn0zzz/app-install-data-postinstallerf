The appendix package provides various ways of formatting the
titles of appendices. Also (sub)appendices environments are
provided that can be used, for example, for per chapter/section
appendices. The word `Appendix or similar can be prepended to
the appendix number for article class documents. The word
`Appendices or similar can be added to the table of contents
before the appendices are listed. The word `Appendices or
similar can be typeset as a \part-like heading (page) in the
body. An appendices environment is provided which can be used
instead of the \appendix command.

  ROBODoc is a documentation tool (based on the AutoDocs program written
a long time ago by Commodore). It extracts specially formatted comment

thus allows you to include the program documentation in the source
code and avoid having to maintain two separate documents.

source code with function names that point their the documentation. It
also can create index tables for all your variables, classes,

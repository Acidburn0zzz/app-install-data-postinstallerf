Comment3='
Skulpture is a GUI style addon for KDE 4. It features a classical
three-dimensional artwork with shadows and smooth gradients to enhance the
visual experience.

Skulpture has been designed to be light and easy on eyes; many distracting
borders or graphical elements have been removed or replaced by simpler
artwork.

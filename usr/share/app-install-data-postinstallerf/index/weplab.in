WepLab is a tool designed to teach how WEP works, what different
vulnerabilities it has, and how they can be used in practice to
break a WEP protected wireless network. So far, WepLab is more than
a Wep Key Cracker, it is a Wep Security Analyzer designed from an
educational point of view. The author has tried to leave the
source code as clear as possible, running away from optimizations
that would obfuscate it.

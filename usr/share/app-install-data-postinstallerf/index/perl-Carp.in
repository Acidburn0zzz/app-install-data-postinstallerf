The Carp routines are useful in your own modules because they act like
die() or warn(), but with a message which is more likely to be useful to a
user of your module. In the case of cluck, confess, and longmess that
context is a summary of every call in the call-stack. For a shorter message
you can use carp or croak which report the error as being from where your
module was called. There is no guarantee that that is where the error was,
but it is a good educated guess.

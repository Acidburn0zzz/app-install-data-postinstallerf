Comment3='
SVNKit provides a replacement for the native JavaHL API - the SVNClient  class
that does not use any native bindings. This SVNClient  also implements
SVNClientInterface (org.tigris.subversion.javahl) as the native one
but uses only the SVNKit library API (written in pure Java!).
If you have code written with using the native SVNClient class,
you may simply replace that class with the new one provided by SVNKit.

Pondus is a personal weight management program written in Python and Gtk+2
released under the GPL. It aims to be simple to use, lightweight and fast.
The data can be plotted to get a quick overview of the history of your weight.
A simple weight planner allows to define "target weights" and this plan can be
compared with the actual measurements in a plot.

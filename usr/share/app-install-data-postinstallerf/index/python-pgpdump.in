Comment3='
python-pgpdump is a Python library for parsing PGP packets. The intent here
is not on completeness, as we dont currently decode every packet type, but
on being able to do what people actually have to 95% of the time.

Currently supported things include
* Signature packets
* Public key packets
* Secret key packets
* Trust, user ID, and user attribute packets

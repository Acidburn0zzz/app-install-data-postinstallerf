Comment3='
This module uses a Patricia Trie data structure to quickly perform IP
address prefix matching for applications such as IP subnet, network or
routing table lookups.  The data structure is based on a radix tree using a
radix of two, so sometimes you see patricia implementations called "radix"
as well.  The term "Trie" is derived from the word "retrieval" but is
pronounced like "try".  Patricia stands for "Practical Algorithm to
Retrieve Information Coded as Alphanumeric", and was first suggested for
routing table lookups by Van Jacobsen.  Patricia Trie performance
characteristics are well-known as it has been employed for routing table
lookups within the BSD kernel since the 4.3 Reno release.

OpenAL Soft is a cross-platform software implementation of the OpenAL 3D
audio API. Its built off of the open-sourced Windows version available
originally from the SVN repository at openal.org. OpenAL provides
capabilities for playing audio in a virtual 3d environment. Distance
attenuation, doppler shift, and directional sound emitters are among
the features handled by the API. More advanced effects, including air
absorption, low-pass filters, and reverb, are available through the
EFX extension. It also facilitates streaming audio, multi-channel buffers,
and audio capture.

This is a collection of functions for dealing with PPI objects, many of
which originated in PerlCritic. They are organized into modules by the
kind of PPI class they relate to, by replacing the "PPI" at the front of
the module name with "PPIxUtilities", e.g. functionality related to
PPINodes is in PPIxUtilitiesNode.

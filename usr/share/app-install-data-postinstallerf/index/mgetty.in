Comment3='
The mgetty package contains a "smart" getty which allows logins over a
serial line (i.e., through a modem). If youre using a Class 2 or 2.0
modem, mgetty can receive faxes. If you also need to send faxes,
youll need to install the sendfax program.

If youll be dialing in to your system using a modem, you should
install the mgetty package. If youd like to send faxes using mgetty
and your modem, youll need to install the mgetty-sendfax program. If
you need a viewer for faxes, youll also need to install the
mgetty-viewfax package.

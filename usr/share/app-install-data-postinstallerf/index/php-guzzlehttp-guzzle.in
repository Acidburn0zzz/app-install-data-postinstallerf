Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client that makes it easy to work with HTTP/1.1 and takes
the pain out of consuming web services.

* Pluggable HTTP adapters that can send requests serially or in parallel
* Doesnt require cURL, but uses cURL by default
* Streams data for both uploads and downloads
* Provides event hooks & plugins for cookies, caching, logging, OAuth, mocks,
  etc
* Keep-Alive & connection pooling
* SSL Verification

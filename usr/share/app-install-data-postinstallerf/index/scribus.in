Scribus is an desktop open source page layout program with
the aim of producing commercial grade output in PDF and
Postscript, primarily, though not exclusively for Linux.

While the goals of the program are for ease of use and simple easy to
understand tools, Scribus offers support for professional publishing
features, such as CMYK color, easy PDF creation, Encapsulated Postscript
import/export and creation of color separations.

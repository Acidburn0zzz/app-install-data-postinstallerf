Comment3='
The MonotoneAutomateStdio class gives a Perl developer access to
Monotones automate stdio facility via an easy to use interface. All
command, option and output formats are handled internally by this
class. Any structured information returned by Monotone is parsed and
returned back to the caller as lists of records for ease of access
(detailed below). One also has the option of accessing Monotones
output as one large string should you prefer.

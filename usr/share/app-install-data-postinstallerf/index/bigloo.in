Bigloo is a Scheme implementation devoted to one goal enabling a Scheme
based programming style where C(++) is usually required.  Bigloo
attempts to make Scheme practical by offering features usually presented
by traditional programming languages but not offered by Scheme and
functional programming.  Bigloo compiles Scheme modules.  It delivers
small and fast standalone binary executables.  Bigloo enables full
connections between Scheme and C programs.

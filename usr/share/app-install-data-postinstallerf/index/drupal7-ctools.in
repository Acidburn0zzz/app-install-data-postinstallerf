This suite is primarily a set of APIs and tools
to improve the developer experience.
It also contains a module called the Page Manager whose job is to manage pages.
In particular it manages panel pages,
but as it grows it will be able to manage far more than just Panels.

For the moment, it includes the following tools
to let other modules implement plug-ins from .inc files.

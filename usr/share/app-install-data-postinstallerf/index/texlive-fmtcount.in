The package provides commands that display the value of a LaTeX
counter in a variety of formats (ordinal, text, hexadecimal,
decimal, octal, binary etc). The package offers some
multilingual support; configurations for use in English (both
British and American usage), French (including Belgian and
Swiss variants), German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish
documents are provided. This package was originally provided as
part of the authors datetime package, but is now distributed
separately.

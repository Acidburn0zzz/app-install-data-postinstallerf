A collection of programs that can be used in a Debian rules file
to automate common tasks related to building Debian packages.
Programs are included to install various files into your package,
compress files, fix file permissions, integrate your package with
the Debian menu system, debconf, doc-base, etc. Most Debian
packages use debhelper as part of their build process.

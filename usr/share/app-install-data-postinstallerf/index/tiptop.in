Hardware performance monitoring counters have recently received a lot of
attention. They have been used by diverse communities to understand and
improve the quality of computing systems For example, architects use them to
extract application characteristics and propose new hardware mechanisms;
compiler writers study how generated code behaves on particular hardware;
software developers identify critical regions of their applications and

propose that counters be used by all categories of users, in particular
non-experts, and we advocate that a few simple metrics derived from these
counters are relevant and useful. For example, a low IPC (number of executed

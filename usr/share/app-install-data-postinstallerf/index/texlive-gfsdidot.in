Comment3='
The design of Didots 1805 Greek typeface was influenced by the
neoclassical ideals of the late 18th century. The font was
brought to Greece at the time of the 1821 Greek Revolution, by
Didots son, and was very widely used. The present version is
provided by the Greek Font Society. The font supports the Greek
alphabet, and is accompanied by a matching Latin alphabet based
on Zapfs Palatino. LaTeX support is provided, using the OT1,
T1 and LGR encodings.

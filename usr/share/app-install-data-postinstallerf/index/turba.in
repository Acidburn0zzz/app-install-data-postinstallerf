Turba is the Horde contact management application, which allows access
to and storage of personal contacts (including name, email address,
phone number, and other easily customizable fields).  Turba integrates
with IMP (Hordes webmail application) as its address book.

The Horde Project writes web applications in PHP and releases them under
Open Source licenses.  For more information (including help with Turba)

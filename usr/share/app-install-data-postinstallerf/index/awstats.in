Advanced Web Statistics is a powerful and featureful tool that generates
advanced web server graphic statistics. This server log analyzer works
from command line or as a CGI and shows you all information your log contains,
in graphical web pages. It can analyze a lot of web/wap/proxy servers like
Apache, IIS, Weblogic, Webstar, Squid, ... but also mail or ftp servers.

This program can measure visits, unique vistors, authenticated users, pages,
domains/countries, OS busiest times, robot visits, type of files, search
engines/keywords used, visits duration, HTTP errors and more...
Statistics can be updated from a browser or your scheduler.

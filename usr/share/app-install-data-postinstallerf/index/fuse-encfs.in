EncFS implements an encrypted filesystem in userspace using FUSE.  FUSE
provides a Linux kernel module which allows virtual filesystems to be written
in userspace.  EncFS encrypts all data and filenames in the filesystem and
passes access through to the underlying filesystem.  Similar to CFS except that
it does not use NFS.

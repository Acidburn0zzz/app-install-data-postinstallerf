This is the freedesktop.org shared MIME info database.

Many programs and desktops use the MIME system to represent the types of
files. Frequently, it is necessary to work out the correct MIME type for
a file. This is generally done by examining the files name or contents,
and looking up the correct MIME type in a database.

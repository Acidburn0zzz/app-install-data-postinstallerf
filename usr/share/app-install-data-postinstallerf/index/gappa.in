Gappa is a tool intended to help verifying and formally prove
properties on numerical programs and circuits handling floating-point
or fixed-point arithmetic.  This tool manipulates logical formulas
stating the enclosures of expressions in some intervals.  Through the
use of rounding operators as part of the expressions, Gappa is specially
designed to deal with formulas that could appear when certifying numerical
codes. In particular, Gappa makes it simple to bound computational errors
due to floating-point arithmetic.  The tool and its documentation were
written by Guillaume Melquiond.

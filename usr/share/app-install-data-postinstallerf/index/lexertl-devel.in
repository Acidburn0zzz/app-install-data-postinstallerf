Lexertl is a modern, modular lexical analyzer generator.  Traditionally,
programs such as lex generate source code as their output and even only
support one kind of programming language.  The lexertl developers are
seeking to offer much more flexibility than that by exposing the state
machine that is generated from a supplied lex specification.  By doing
this the user has much more freedom in how the data is processed, which
means it becomes easy to
- Build a lexical analyzer at runtime and start using it immediately.
- Generate source code from the state machine in your preferred
  programming language.

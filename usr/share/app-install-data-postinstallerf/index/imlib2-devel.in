This package contains development files for imlib2.

Imlib 2 is a library that does image file loading and saving as well
as rendering, manipulation, arbitrary polygon support, etc.  It does
ALL of these operations FAST. Imlib2 also tries to be highly
intelligent about doing them, so writing naive programs can be done
easily, without sacrificing speed.  This is a complete rewrite over
the Imlib 1.x series. The architecture is more modular, simple, and
flexible.

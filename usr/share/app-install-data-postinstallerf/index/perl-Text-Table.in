Comment3='
Organization of data in table form is a time-honored and useful method of
data representation. While columns of data are trivially generated by
computer through formatted output, even simple tasks like keeping titles
aligned with the data columns are not trivial, and the one-shot solutions
one comes up with tend to be particularly hard to maintain. TextTable
allows you to create and maintain tables that adapt to alignment
requirements as you use them.

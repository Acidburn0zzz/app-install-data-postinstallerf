Comment3='
the GNU C Library (glibc) providing host name resolution via Multicast DNS
(aka Zeroconf, aka Apple Rendezvous, aka Apple Bonjour), effectively allowing
name resolution by common Unix/Linux programs in the ad-hoc mDNS domain .local.

nss-mdns provides client functionality only, which means that you have to
run a mDNS responder daemon separately from nss-mdns if you want to register
the local host name via mDNS (e.g. Avahi).

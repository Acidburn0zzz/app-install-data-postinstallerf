R-qtl is an extensible, interactive environment for mapping
quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in experimental crosses. Our goal is to
make complex QTL mapping methods widely accessible and allow users to
focus on modeling rather than computing.

A key component of computational methods for QTL mapping is the hidden
Markov model (HMM) technology for dealing with missing genotype
data. We have implemented the main HMM algorithms, with allowance for
the presence of genotyping errors, for backcrosses, intercrosses, and
phase-known four-way crosses.

KTechlab is a development and simulation environment for micro-controllers
and electronic circuits. KTechlab consists of several well-integrated
components A circuit simulator, capable of simulating logic, linear devices
and some nonlinear devices. Integration with gpsim, allowing PICs to be
simulated in circuit. A schematic editor, which provides a rich real-time
feedback of the simulation. A flowchart editor, allowing PIC programs to be
constructed visually. MicroBASIC; a BASIC-like compiler for PICs, written as
a companion program to KTechlab. An embedded Kate part, which provides a
powerful editor for PIC programs. Integrated assembler and disassembler via
gpasm and gpdasm.

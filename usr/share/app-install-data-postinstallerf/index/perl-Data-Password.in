This modules checks potential passwords for crackability. It checks that
the password is in the appropriate length, that it has enough character
groups, that it does not contain the same chars repeatedly or ascending or
descending characters, or charcters close to each other in the keyboard. It
will also attempt to search the ispell word file for existance of whole
words.

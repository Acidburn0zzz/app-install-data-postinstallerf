libguess employs discrete-finite automata to deduce the character set of
the input buffer. The advantage of this is that all character sets can be
checked in parallel, and quickly. Right now, libguess passes a byte to
each DFA on the same pass, meaning that the winning character set can be
deduced as efficiently as possible.

libguess is fully reentrant, using only local stack memory for DFA
operations.

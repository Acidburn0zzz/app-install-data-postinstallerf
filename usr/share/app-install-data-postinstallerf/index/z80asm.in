z80asm is an assembler for the Z80 microprocessor. The assembler aims
to be portable and complete. Of course it assembles all official
mnemonics, but it also aims to assemble the unofficial mnemonics.
The assembler was written with the MSX computer in mind as the target
platform, but it can be used for any system with a Z80 in it. Some
header files with labels of MSX specific addresses (BIOS, BDOS, system
variables) are included.

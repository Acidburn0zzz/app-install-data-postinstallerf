ulogd is a logging daemon that reads event messages coming from the Netfilter
connection tracking and the Netfilter packet logging subsystem. You have to
enable support for connection tracking event delivery; ctnetlink and the NFLOG
target in your Linux kernel 2.6.x or load their respective modules. The
deprecated ULOG target (which has been superseded by NFLOG) is also supported.

Comment3='
LuaTeX operates by default in UTF-8 input; thus LaTeX documents
that need 8-bit character-sets need special treatment. (In
package, therefore, replaces the LaTeX standard inputenc for
use under LuaTeX. With a current LuaTeX,the package has the
same behaviour with LuaTeX as inputenc has under pdfTeX.

mksh is the MirBSD enhanced version of the Public Domain Korn shell (pdksh),
a bourne-compatible shell which is largely similar to the original AT&T Korn
shell. It includes bug fixes and feature improvements in order to produce a
modern, robust shell good for interactive and especially script use, being a
bourne shell replacement, pdksh successor and an alternative to the C shell.

Comment3='
JNA provides Java programs easy access to native shared libraries
(DLLs on Windows) without writing anything but Java code. JNAs
design aims to provide native access in a natural way with a
minimum of effort. No boilerplate or generated code is required.
While some attention is paid to performance, correctness and ease
of use take priority.

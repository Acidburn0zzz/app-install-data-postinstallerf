Comment3='
assertEquals is an interface for running tests written with the Python
standard librarys unittest module. It used to be named testosterone.
It delivers summary and detail reports on TestCases discovered in
module-space, via both a command-line and a curses(3) interface. The
interactive mode is the default, but it depends on the non-interactive mode.
For debugging, static tracebacks and interactive Python debugger (Pdb)
sessions are available in both scripted and interactive modes.

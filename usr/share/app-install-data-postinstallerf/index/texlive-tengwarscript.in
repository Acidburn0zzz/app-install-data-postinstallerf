Comment3='
The package provides "mid-level" access to tengwar fonts,
providing good quality output. Each tengwar sign is represented
by a command, which will place the sign nicely in relation to
previous signs. A transcription package is available from the
packages home page writing all those tengwar commands would
quickly become untenable. The package supports the use of a
wide variety of tengwar fonts that are available from the net;
metric and map files are provided for all the supported fonts.

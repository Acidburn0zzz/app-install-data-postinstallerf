Charis SIL provides glyphs for a wide range of Latin and Cyrillic characters.
Charis is similar to Bitstream Charter, one of the first fonts designed
specifically for laser printers. It is highly readable and holds up well in
less-than-ideal reproduction environments. It also has a full set of styles
? regular, italic, bold, bold italic ? and so is more useful in general
publishing than Doulos SIL. Charis is a serif proportionally spaced font
optimized for readability in long printed documents.

The Charis SIL Compact fonts were derived from Charis SIL using SIL TypeTuner,
by setting the ?Line spacing? feature to ?Tight?, and they cannot be TypeTuned

Kronolith is the Horde calendar application.  It provides repeating
events, all-day events, custom fields, keywords, and managing multiple
users through Horde Authentication.  The calendar API that Kronolith
uses is abstracted; MCAL and SQL drivers are currently provided.

The Horde Project writes web applications in PHP and releases them under
Open Source licenses.  For more information (including help with Kronolith)

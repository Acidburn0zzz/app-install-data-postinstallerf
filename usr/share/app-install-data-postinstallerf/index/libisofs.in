Libisofs is a library to create an ISO-9660 filesystem and supports
extensions like RockRidge or Joliet. It is also a full featured
ISO-9660 editor, allowing you to modify an ISO image or multisession
disc, including file addition or removal, change of file names and
attributes etc. It supports the extension AAIP which allows to store
ACLs and xattr in ISO-9660 filesystems as well. As it is linked with
zlib, it supports zisofs compression, too.

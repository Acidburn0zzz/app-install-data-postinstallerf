Comment3='
BLOP comprises a set of LADSPA plugins that generate bandlimited
sawtooth, square, variable pulse and slope-variable triangle waves,
for use in LADSPA hosts, principally for use with one of the many
modular software synthesisers available.

They are wavetable based, and are designed to produce output with
harmonic content as high as possible over a wide pitch range.

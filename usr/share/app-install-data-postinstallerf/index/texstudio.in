TeXstudio, formerly known as TexmakerX is a fork of the
LaTeX IDE TexMaker and gives you an environment where you can
easily create and manage LaTeX documents.
It provides modern writing support, like interactive spell checking,
code folding and syntax highlighting.
Also it serves as a starting point from where you can easily run
all necessary LaTeX tools.
Although TeXstudio has a lot of additional features,
it tries to be like an improved version of Texmaker,
so it keeps it look&feel.

Comment='<span size="xx-large">A lazy infinite trie of integers</span>'
Comment3='
Provides a minimal infinite, lazy trie for integral types. It intentionally
leaves out ideas such as delete and emptiness so that it can be used lazily,
eg as the target of an infinite foldr. Essentially its purpose is to be
an efficient implementation of a function from integral type, given
point-at-a-time modifications.

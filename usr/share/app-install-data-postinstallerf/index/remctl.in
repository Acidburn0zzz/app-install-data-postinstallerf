Comment3='

remctl (the client) and remctld (the server) implement a client/server
protocol for running single commands on a remote host using Kerberos
v5 authentication and returning the output. They use a very simple
GSS-API-authenticated network protocol, combined with server-side ACL
support and a server configuration file that maps remctl commands to
programs that should be run when that command is called by an
authorised user.

Comment3='
Contains backends, filters, and other software that was
once part of the core CUPS distribution but is no longer maintained by
Apple Inc. In addition it contains additional filters developed
independently of Apple, especially filters for the PDF-centric printing
workflow introduced by OpenPrinting.

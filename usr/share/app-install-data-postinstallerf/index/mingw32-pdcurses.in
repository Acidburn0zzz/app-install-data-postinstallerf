PDCurses is a public domain curses library for DOS, OS/2, Win32, X11
and SDL, implementing most of the functions available in X/Open and
System V R4 curses. It supports many compilers for these
platforms. The X11 port lets you recompile existing text-mode curses
programs to produce native X11 applications.

Note that ncurses is not available for MinGW / Windows.  Applications
which need curses functionality can use this package, provided they
dont use any of the extensions specific to ncurses.

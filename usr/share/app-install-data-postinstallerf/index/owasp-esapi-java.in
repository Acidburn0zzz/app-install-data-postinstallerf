OWASP ESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API) is a free, open source,
web application security control library that makes it easier for programmers
to write lower-risk applications. The ESAPI for Java library is designed to
make it easier for programmers to retrofit security into existing applications.
ESAPI for Java also serves as a solid foundation for new development.

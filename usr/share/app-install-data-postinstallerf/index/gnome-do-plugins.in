GNOME Do allows you to quickly search for many objects present in your
GNOME desktop environment (applications, Evolution contacts, Firefox
bookmarks, files, artists and albums in Rhythmbox, Pidgin buddies) and
perform commonly used commands on those objects (Run, Open, Email,
Chat, Play, etc.).

This package contains various plugins for GNOME Do.

Mailx is an enhanced mail command, which provides the functionality
of the POSIX mailx command, as well as SysV mail and Berkeley Mail
(from which it is derived).

Additionally to the POSIX features, mailx can work with Maildir/ e-mail
storage format (as well as mailboxes), supports IMAP, POP3 and SMTP
protocols (including over SSL) to operate with remote hosts, handles mime
types and different charsets. There are a lot of other useful features,
see mailx(1).

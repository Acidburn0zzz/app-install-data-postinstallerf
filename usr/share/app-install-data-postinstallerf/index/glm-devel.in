GLM is a C++ library for doing mathematics operations
required in many OpenGL based applications. Its interface
has been designed to resemble the built-in matrix and vector
types of the OpenGL shading language.

glm-devel is only required for building software that uses
the GLM library. Because GLM currently is a header-only library,
there is no matching run time package.

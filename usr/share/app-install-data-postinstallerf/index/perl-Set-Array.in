Comment3='
SetArray allows you to create arrays as objects and use OO-style methods
on them. Many convenient methods are provided here that appear in the
FAQs, the Perl Cookbook or posts from comp.lang.perl.misc. In addition,
there are Set methods with corresponding (overloaded) operators for the
purpose of Set comparison, i.e. +, ==, etc.

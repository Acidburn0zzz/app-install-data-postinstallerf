Comment3='
The Xvid video codec implements MPEG-4 Simple Profile and Advanced Simple
Profile standards. It permits compressing and decompressing digital video
in order to reduce the required bandwidth of video data for transmission
over computer networks or efficient storage on CDs or DVDs. Due to its
unrivalled quality Xvid has gained great popularity and is used in many
other GPLed applications, like e.g. Transcode, MEncoder, MPlayer, Xine and
many more.

Newt is a programming library for color text mode, widget based user
interfaces.  Newt can be used to add stacked windows, entry widgets,
checkboxes, radio buttons, labels, plain text fields, scrollbars,
etc., to text mode user interfaces.  This package also contains the
shared library needed by programs built with newt, as well as a
/usr/bin/dialog replacement called whiptail.  Newt is based on the
slang library.

Comment3='
The package, based on pxfonts, provides many fixes and
enhancements to that package, and splits it in two parts
(newpxtext and newpxmath) which may be run independently of one
another. It provides scaling, improved metrics, and other
options. For proper operation, the packages require that the
packages newtxmath and txfonts be installed and their map files
enabled.

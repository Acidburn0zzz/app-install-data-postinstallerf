SVG Salamander is an SVG engine for Java thats designed to be small, fast,
and allow programmers to use it with a minimum of fuss. Its in particular
targeted for making it easy to integrate SVG into Java games and making it
much easier for artists to design 2D game content - from rich interactive
menus to charts and graphcs to complex animations.

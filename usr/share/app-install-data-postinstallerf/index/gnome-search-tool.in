GNOME Search Tool is a utility for finding files on your system. To perform a
basic search, you can type a filename or a partial filename, with or without
wildcards. To refine your search, you can apply additional search options.

GNOME Search Tool uses the find, grep, and locate UNIX commands. Since the
find, grep, and locate commands support the -i option, all searches are
case-insensitive.

Comment3='
The Oslo project intends to produce a python library containing
infrastructure code shared by OpenStack projects. The APIs provided
by the project should be high quality, stable, consistent and generally
useful.

The Oslo messaging API supports RPC and notifications over a number of
different messaging transports.

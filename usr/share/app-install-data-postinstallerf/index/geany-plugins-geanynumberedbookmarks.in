GeanyNumberedBookmarks is a plugin to provide users with 10 numbered
bookmarks (in addition to the usual bookmarks). It started out as part of
the ConText feature parity plugin, which was split into individual plugins
to better suit Geanys ethos of being as light as possible while allowing
users to select which features they want to add to the core editor. The idea
was taken from a Text Editor for Windows called ConText.

Normally if you had more than one bookmark, you would have to cycle through
them until you reached the one you wanted. With this plugin you can go
straight to the bookmark that you want with a single key combination.

Bandwidthd is a UNIX daemon/Windows service for graphing the traffic
generated by each machine on several configurable subnets.  It is much
easier to configure than MRTG, and provides significantly more useful
information.  MRTG only tells you how much bandwidth you are using,
Bandwidthd tells you that, and who is using it.

Each IP address that has moved any significant volume of traffic has its
own graph.  The graphs are color coded to help you figure out at a glance
if your user is surfing the web, or surfing Kazaa.

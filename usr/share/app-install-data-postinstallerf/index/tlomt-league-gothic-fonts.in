League Gothic is a revival of an old classic, Alternate Gothic No.1.
It was originally designed by Morris Fuller Benton for the American
Type Founders Company (ATF) in 1903. The company went bankrupt in 1993.
And since the original typeface was created before 1923, the typeface
is in the public domain. It is a sans serif gothic typeface.

This is actually another version of the font which was made by
The League of Movable Type and contributed to the Open Source Type
Movement.

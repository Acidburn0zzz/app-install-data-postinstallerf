"Julius" is a high-performance, two-pass large vocabulary continuous speech
recognition (LVCSR) decoder software for speech-related researchers and
developers. Based on word N-gram and context-dependent HMM, it can perform
almost real-time decoding on most current PCs in 60k word dictation task.
Major search techniques are fully incorporated such as tree lexicon, N-gram
factoring, cross-word context dependency handling, enveloped beam search,
Gaussian pruning, Gaussian selection, etc. Besides search efficiency, it is
also modularized carefully to be independent from model structures, and
various HMM types are supported such as shared-state triphones and
tied-mixture models, with any number of mixtures, states, or phones.

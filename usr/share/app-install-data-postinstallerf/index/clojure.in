Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java
Virtual Machine. It is designed to be a general-purpose language,
combining the approachability and interactive development of a
scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for
multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language - it
compiles directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains completely
dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is supported at
runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with
optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java
can avoid reflection.

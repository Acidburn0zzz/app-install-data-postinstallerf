GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of elements which
operate on media data.

This package contains well-written plug-ins that cant be shipped in
gstreamer-plugins-good because
- the license is not LGPL
- the license of the library is not LGPL
- there are possible licensing issues with the code.

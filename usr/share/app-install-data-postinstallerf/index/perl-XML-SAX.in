XMLSAX consists of several framework classes for using and building
Perl SAX2 XML parsers, filters, and drivers. It is designed around the
need to be able to "plug in" different SAX parsers to an application
without requiring programmer intervention. Those of you familiar with
the DBI will be right at home. Some of the designs come from the Java
JAXP specification (SAX part), only without the javaness.

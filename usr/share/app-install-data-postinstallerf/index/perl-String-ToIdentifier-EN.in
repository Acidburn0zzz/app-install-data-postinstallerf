This module provides a utility method, "to_identifier" for converting an
arbitrary string into a readable representation using the ASCII subset of
\w for use as an identifier in a computer program. The intent is to make
unique identifier names from which the content of the original string can
be easily inferred by a human just by reading the identifier.

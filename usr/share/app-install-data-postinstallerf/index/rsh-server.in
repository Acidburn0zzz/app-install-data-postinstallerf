The rsh-server package contains a set of programs which allow users
to run commands on remote machines, login to other machines and copy
files between machines (rsh, rlogin and rcp).  All three of these
commands use rhosts style authentication.  This package contains the

All of these servers are run by systemd and configured using
systemd units and PAM.

The rsh-server package should be installed to enable remote access

Comment3='
Scraper2vdr acts as client and provides scraped metadata for tvshows and
movies from epgd to other plugins via its service interface. The plugin
cares about caching the images locally and also cleans up the images if
not longer needed.

epgd itself uses the thetvdb.com API for collecting series metadata and
themoviedb.org API for movies. Check the websites of both services for
the terms of use.

Wcd.   Directory changer for DOS and Unix.  Another Norton
Change Directory (NCD) clone.

Wcd is a command-line program to change directory fast. It
saves time typing at the keyboard.  One needs to type only
a part of a directory  name and wcd  will jump to it.  Wcd
has a fast selection  method  in  case of multiple matches
and allows aliasing and  banning of directories.  Wcd also
includes a full-screen interactive  directory tree browser
with speed search.

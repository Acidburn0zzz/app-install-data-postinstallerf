Comment3='
Secure, fast, compliant and very flexible web-server which has been optimized
for high-performance environments. It has a very low memory footprint compared
to other webservers and takes care of cpu-load. Its advanced feature-set
(FastCGI, CGI, Auth, Output-Compression, URL-Rewriting and many more) make
it the perfect webserver-software for every server that is suffering load
problems.

The TraitsUI package is a set of user interface tools designed to complement
Traits. In the simplest case, it can automatically generate a user interface
for editing a Traits-based object, with no additional coding on the part of
the programmer-user. In more sophisticated uses, it can implement a Model-
View-Controller (MVC) design pattern for Traits-based objects.

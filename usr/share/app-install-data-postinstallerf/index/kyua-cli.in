Kyua (pronounced Q.A.) is a testing framework for both developers and
users.  Kyua is different from most other testing frameworks in that it
puts the end user experience before anything else.  There are multiple
reasons for users to run the tests themselves, and Kyua ensures that
they can do so in the most convenient way.

This module, kyua-cli, provides the command-line interface to the Kyua
run-time system in other words, the kyua binary.  The major purpose
of this tool is to run test cases and generate unified reports of
their results.

Comment3='
TSE3 is a powerful open source sequencer engine written in C++. It is a
sequencer engine because it provides the actual driving force elements of a
sequencer but provides no form of user interface. Sequencer applications or
multimedia presentation packages will incorporate the TSE3 libraries to
provide a user with MIDI sequencing facilities.

This package holds the development documentation, examples and header files
for TSE3.

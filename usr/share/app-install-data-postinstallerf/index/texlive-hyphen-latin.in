Hyphenation patterns for Latin in T1/EC and UTF-8 encodings,
mainly in modern spelling (u when u is needed and v when v is
needed), medieval spelling with the ligatures \ae and \oe and
the (uncial) lowercase v written as a u is also supported.
Apparently there is no conflict between the patterns of modern
Latin and those of medieval Latin.

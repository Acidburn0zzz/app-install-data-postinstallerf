Comment3='
Previous to Node v0.8.x, there was an undocumented "keypress" event that
process.stdin would emit when it was a TTY. Some people discovered this
hidden gem, and started using it in their own code.

In Node v0.8.x, this "keypress" event does not get emitted by default,
but rather only when it is being used in conjunction with the readline
(or by extension, the repl) module.
This module is the exact logic from the node v0.8.x releases ripped out
into its own module.

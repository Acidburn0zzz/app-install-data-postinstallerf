Kapow is a punch clock program designed to easily keep track of your hours,
whether youre working on one project or many. Simply clock in and out with the
Start/Stop button. If you make a mistake in your hours, you can go back and
edit any of the entries by double-clicking on the session in question. Kapow
also allows you to easily keep track of the hours since you last billed a
work after the last billed session.

This package is the Polish extension of the Computer Modern
fonts (known as PL fonts),in Adobe Type 1 (PostScript) format.
The fonts use the same .tfm files as for the version generated
by MetaFont. This release of fonts was adapted to the (mostly
guessed) demands of the Windows environment, while keeping the
fonts usable with TeX; however, encoding files are now added,
as Windows and TeX use different encoding schemes.

Frodo V4.1 is a free, portable C64 emulator for BeOS, Unix, MacOS,
AmigaOS, RiscOS and WinNT/95 systems.

This emulator focuses on the exact reproduction of special graphical
effects possible on the C64, and has therefore relatively high system
requirements. It should only be run on systems with at least a
PowerPC/Pentium/68060. Frodo is capable of running most games and
demos correctly, even those with FLI, FLD, DYCP, open borders,
multiplexed sprites, timing dependent decoders, fast loaders etc. 6510
emulation All undocumented opcodes, 100 percent correct decimal mode,

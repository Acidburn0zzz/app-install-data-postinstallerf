Comment3='
Transparently adds connection pooling to your existing JDBC driver.
Complies with the J2SE API, giving you the confidence to develop to
standards. You can monitor the performance of your database
connections and listen to connection events.
Its easy to configure using the JDBC API, XML, or Java property
files - you decide.

Comment3='
CodeSynthesis XSD is an open-source, cross-platform W3C XML Schema to
C++ data binding compiler. Provided with an XML instance specification
(XML Schema), it generates C++ classes that represent the given
vocabulary as well as parsing and serialization code.
You can then access the data stored in XML using types and functions
that semantically correspond to your application domain rather than
dealing with intricacies of reading and writing XML.

Comment3='
Chromaprint and its associated Acoustid Web service make up a
high-quality, open-source acoustic fingerprinting system. This package
provides Python bindings for both the fingerprinting algorithm
library, which is written in C but portable, and the Web service,
which provides fingerprint look ups.

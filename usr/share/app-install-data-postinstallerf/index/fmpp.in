FMPP is a general-purpose text file preprocessor tool that uses
FreeMarker templates. It is particularly designed for HTML
preprocessor, to generate complete (static) homepages directory
structure that contains HTML-s, image files, etc. But of course it can
be used to generate source code or whatever text files. FMPP is
extendable with Java classes to pull data from any data sources
(database, etc.) and embed the data into the generated files.

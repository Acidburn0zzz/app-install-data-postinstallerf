QTikZ is a small application to assist in the creation of diagrams and drawings
using the TikZ macros from the LaTeX package "pgf". It consists of a text editor
pane in which the TikZ code for the drawing is edited and a preview pane showing
the drawing as rendered by LaTeX. The preview pane can be updated in
real-time. Common drawing tools, options and styles are available from the menus
to assist the coding process.

This package contains the Qt version of the program.

Comment3='
bsdiff and bspatch are tools for building and applying patches to binary files.
By using suffix sorting (specifically, Larsson and Sadakanes qsufsort) and
taking advantage of how executable files change, bsdiff routinely produces
binary patches 50-80% smaller than those produced by Xdelta, and 15% smaller
than those produced by .RTPatch.

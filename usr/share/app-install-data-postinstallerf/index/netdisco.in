Netdisco is a network management application targeted at large
corporate and university networks. Data is collected into a Postgres
database using SNMP and presented with a clean web interface using Mason.

Designed for moderate to large networks, configuration information
and connection data for network devices are retrieved by SNMP.
With Netdisco you can locate the switch port of an end-user system
by IP or MAC address. Data is stored using a SQL database for scalability
and speed. Layer-2 topology protocols such as CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol)
optionally provides automatic discovery of the network topology.

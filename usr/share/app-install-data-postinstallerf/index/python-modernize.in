This library is a very thin wrapper around lib2to3 to utilize it
to make Python 2 code more modern with the intention of eventually
porting it over to Python 3.

It attempts, but does not guarantee, to generate a Python 2/3 compatible
codebase.  The code that it generates needs python2.6+ and has a runtime
dependency on python-six.

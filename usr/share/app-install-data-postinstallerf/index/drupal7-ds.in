Display Suite allows you to take full control over how your content is displayed
using a drag and drop interface. Arrange your nodes, views, comments, user data
etc. the way you want without having to work your way through dozens of template
files. A predefined list of layouts (D7 only) is available for even more drag
and drop fun!

By defining custom view modes (build modes in D6), you can define how one piece
of content should be displayed in different places such as teaser lists, search
results, the full node, views etc.

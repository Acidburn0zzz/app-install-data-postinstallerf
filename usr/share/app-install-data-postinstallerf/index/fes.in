Comment3='
This external library implements an efficient implement of exhaustive
search to solve systems of low-degree boolean equations. Exhaustive
search is asymptotically faster than computing a Groebner basis,
except in special cases. This particular implementation is
particularly efficient (in the good cases it tests 3 candidate
solutions per CPU cycle on each core).

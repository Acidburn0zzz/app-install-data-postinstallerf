CMPFIT uses the Levenberg-Marquardt technique to solve the least-squares
problem. In its typical use, CMPFIT will be used to fit a user-supplied
function (the "model") to user-supplied data points (the "data") by adjusting
a set of parameters. CMPFIT is based upon MINPACK-1 (LMDIF.F) by More and
collaborators.

The plugin looks for $$latex math$$ patterns, and replaces them by the rendered
latex output by way of latex and imagemagick. The graphics is only displayed
locally, so your conversation partner will have to use the plugin, too
(With MSN, this constraint might not hold). This plugin is compatible with the
similar kopete latex plugin, as it uses the $$ as delimiters, too.

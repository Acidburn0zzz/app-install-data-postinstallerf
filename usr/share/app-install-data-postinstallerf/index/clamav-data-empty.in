Comment3='
This is an empty package to fulfill inter-package dependencies of the
clamav suite. This package and the clamav-data package are mutually
exclusive.

Use -data when you want a working (but perhaps outdated) virus scanner
immediately after package installation.
Use -data-empty when you are updating the virus database regulary and
do not want to download a >5MB sized rpm-package with outdated virus
definitions.

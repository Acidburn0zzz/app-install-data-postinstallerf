Tango is a cross-platform open-source software library, written in the D
programming language for D programmers. It is structured as a cohesive and
comprehensive library for general purpose usage, and is supported by a growing
number of recognized D enthusiasts.
This package contains static libraries and header files that applications can
use to build against tango.
Include *.d file from tango project for import to your project (it is same
thing as header file *.h in C/C++).
Availability of solid and extensive documentation represents a prime factor in
library accessibility, and thus this project is as much about documentation

NetSED is small and handful utility designed to alter the contents of
packets forwarded through your network in real time. It is really useful
for network hackers in following applications

* black-box protocol auditing - whenever there are two or more
  proprietary boxes communicating over undocumented protocol (by enforcing
  changes in ongoing transmissions, you will be able to test if tested
  application is secure),
* fuzz-alike experiments, integrity tests - whenever you want to test
  stability of the application and see how it ensures data integrity,

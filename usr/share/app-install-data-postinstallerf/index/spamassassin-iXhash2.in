Comment3='
iXhash2 is an unofficial improved version of the iXhash spam filter
plugin for SpamAssassin, adding async DNS lookups for performance and
removing unneeded features but fully compatible with the iXhash 1.5.5
(http//www.ixhash.net/) implementation. It computes MD5 checksums of
fragments of the body of an e-mail and compares them to those of known
spam using DNS queries to a RBL-like name server. So it works similar
to the standard plugins that use the Pyzor, Razor and DCC software
packages from within SpamAssassin.

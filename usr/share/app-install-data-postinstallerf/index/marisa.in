Matching Algorithm with Recursively Implemented StorAge (MARISA) is a
static and space-efficient trie data structure. And libmarisa is a C++
library to provide an implementation of MARISA. Also, the package of
libmarisa contains a set of command line tools for building and
operating a MARISA-based dictionary.

A MARISA-based dictionary supports not only lookup but also reverse
lookup, common prefix search and predictive search.

The Client-side adaptive image module helps build responsive web designs with
fluid images by providing an Image field formatter that allows you to select
appropriate image styles for various client widths. With this module, you can
ensure that for each Image field only the most appropriately sized image gets
downloaded by the client.

You can serve light images to mobile users while still providing the best
quality images to visitors equipped with large screens.

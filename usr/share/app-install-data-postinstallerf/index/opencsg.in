OpenCSG is a library that does image-based CSG rendering using OpenGL.

CSG is short for Constructive Solid Geometry and denotes an approach to model
complex 3D-shapes using simpler ones. I.e., two shapes can be combined by
taking the union of them, by intersecting them, or by subtracting one shape
of the other. The most basic shapes, which are not result of such a CSG
operation, are called primitives. Primitives must be solid, i.e., they must
have a clearly defined interior and exterior. By construction, a CSG shape is
also solid then.

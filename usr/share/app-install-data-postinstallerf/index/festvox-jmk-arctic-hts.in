Comment3='
US English male speaker ("JMK") voice for Festival. JMK is a native Canadian
English speaker, but the voice uses the US English front end.

This is a HMM-based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) voice from the Nagoya
Institute of Technology, trained using the CMU ARCTIC database. This voice
is based on 1138 utterances spoken by a US English male speaker. The speaker
is experienced in building synthetic voices. This was recorded at 16bit
32KHz, in a sound proof room, in stereo, one channel was the waveform, the
other EGG. The database was automatically labelled using CMU Sphinx using
the FestVox labelling scripts. No hand correction has been made.

owfs-server is the back-end component of the OWFS 1-wire bus control system.
owserver arbitrates access to the bus from multiple client processes. The
physical bus is usually connected to a serial or USB port, and other processes
connect to owserver over network sockets (TCP port). Communication can be local
or over a network.

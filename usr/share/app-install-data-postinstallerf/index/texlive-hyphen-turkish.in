Hyphenation patterns for Turkish in T1/EC and UTF-8 encodings.
The patterns for Turkish were first produced for the Ottoman
Texts Project in 1987 and were suitable for both Modern Turkish
and Ottoman Turkish in Latin script, however the required
character set didnt fit into EC encoding, so support for
Ottoman Turkish had to be dropped to keep compatibility with 8-
bit engines.

The Computational Fluid Dynamics General Notation System (CGNS) provides
a general, portable, and extensible standard for the storage and
retrieval of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis
data. It consists of a collection of conventions, and free
and open software implementing those conventions. It is
self-descriptive, machine-independent, well-documented, and
administered by an international steering committee.

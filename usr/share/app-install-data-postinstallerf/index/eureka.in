Eureka is a cross-platform map editor for the classic DOOM games.

It started when the ported the Yadex editor to a proper GUI toolkit, namely
FLTK, and implemented a system for multi-level Undo / Redo. These and other
features have required rewriting large potions of the existing code, and adding
lots of new code too. Eureka is now an independent program with its own
work-flow and its own quirks.

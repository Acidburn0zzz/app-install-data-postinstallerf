Libisoburn is a front-end for libraries libburn and libisofs which
enables creation and expansion of ISO-9660 filesystems on all CD/
DVD/BD media supported by libburn. This includes media like DVD+RW,
which do not support multi-session management on media level and
even plain disk files or block devices. Price for that is thorough
specialization on data files in ISO-9660 filesystem images. And so
libisoburn is not suitable for audio (CD-DA) or any other CD layout
which does not entirely consist of ISO-9660 sessions.

Comment3='
Perl Support implements a Perl-IDE for Vim/gVim. It is written to considerably
speed up writing code in a consistent style.  This is done by inserting
complete statements, comments, idioms, code snippets, templates, and POD
documentation.  Reading perldoc is integrated.  Syntax checking, running a
script, running perltidy,  running perlcritics, starting a debugger and a
profiler can be done with a keystroke.

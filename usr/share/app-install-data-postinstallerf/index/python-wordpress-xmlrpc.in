Comment3='
Python library to interface with a WordPress blogs XML-RPC API.

An implementation of the standard WordPress API methods is provided, but the
library is designed for easy integration with custom XML-RPC API methods
provided by plugins.
A set of classes are provided that wrap the standard WordPress data types
(e.g., Blog, Post, User). The provided method implementations return these
objects when possible.

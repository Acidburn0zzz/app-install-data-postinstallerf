JHighlight is an embeddable pure Java syntax highlighting library that supports
Java, Groovy, C++, HTML, XHTML, XML and LZX languages and outputs to XHTML. It
also supports RIFE (http//rifers.org) templates tags and highlights them
clearly so that you can easily identify the difference between your RIFE markup
and the actual marked up source.

Comment3='
KDESvn is a frontend to the subversion vcs. In difference to most other
tools it uses the subversion C-Api direct via a c++ wrapper made by Rapid
SVN and doesnt parse the output of the subversion client. So it is a real
client itself instead of a frontend to the command line tool.

It is designed for the K-Desktop environment and uses all of the goodies
it has. It is planned for future that based on the native client some plugins
for konqueror and/or kate will made.

Comment3='
This is an icon-theme maintained with Xfce in mind,
but it supports other desktops like Gnome3 as well.
Its a fork of the upstream elementary-project,
which took place because the team decided to
drop a lot of desktop-specific symlinks.
This icon-theme is supposed to keep everything
working, but well still pull new icons from upstream
and integrate them occasionally.

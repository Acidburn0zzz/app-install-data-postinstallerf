Comment3='
Idris is a general purpose language with full dependent types.
It is compiled, with eager evaluation. Dependent types allow types to
be predicated on values, meaning that some aspects of a programs
behavior can be specified precisely in the type. The language is
closely related to Epigram and Agda. There is a tutorial at
<http//www.idris-lang.org/documentation>. Features include

- Full dependent types with dependent pattern matching
- where clauses, with rule, simple case expressions,
  pattern matching let and lambda bindings

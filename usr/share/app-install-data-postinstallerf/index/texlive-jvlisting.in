This package provides a LaTeX environment listing, an
alternative to the built-in verbatim environment. The listing
environment is tailored for including listings of computer
program source code into documents. The main advantages over
the original verbatim environment are - environments
automatically fixes leading whitespace so that the environment
and program listing can be indented with the rest of the
document source, and; - listing environments may easily be
customised and extended.

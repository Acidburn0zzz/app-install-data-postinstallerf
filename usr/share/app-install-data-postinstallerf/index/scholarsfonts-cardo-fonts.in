Cardo is a large Unicode font specifically designed for the needs of
classicists, Biblical scholars, medievalists, and linguists.  Since it may be
used to prepare materials for publication, it also contains features that are
required for high-quality typography, such as ligatures, text figures (also
known as old style numerals), true small capitals and a variety of punctuation
and space characters.  It may also be used to document and discuss the features
of Unicode that are applicable to the these disciplines, as we work to help
colleagues understand the value (and limitations) of Unicode.
This font has been revived in modern times under several names (Bembo, Aetna,
Aldine 401).

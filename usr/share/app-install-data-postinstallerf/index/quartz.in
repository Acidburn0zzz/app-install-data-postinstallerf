Quartz is a job scheduling system that can be integrated with, or used
along side virtually any J2EE or J2SE application. Quartz can be used
to create simple or complex schedules for executing tens, hundreds, or
even tens-of-thousands of jobs; jobs whose tasks are defined as standard
Java components or EJBs.

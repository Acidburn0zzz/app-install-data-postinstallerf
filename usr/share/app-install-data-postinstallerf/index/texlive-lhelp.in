This package defines macros which are useful for many
documents. It is a large collection of simple little helpers
which do not really warrant a separate package on their own.
Included are, among other things, definitions of common units
with preceeding thinspaces, framed boxes where both width and
height can be specified, starting new odd or even pages, draft
markers, notes, conditional includes, including EPS files, and
versions of enumerate and itemize which allow the horizontal
and vertical spacing to be changed.

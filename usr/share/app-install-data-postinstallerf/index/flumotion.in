Flumotion is a GPL streaming media server written in Python. It is distributed
and component-based every step in the streaming process (production,
conversion, consumption) can be run inside a separate process on separate
machines.

Flumotion uses Twisted and GStreamer. Twisted enables the high-level
functionality, distributing components over the network. GStreamer, through the
Python bindings, enables the high-speed low-level functionality actual media
processing.

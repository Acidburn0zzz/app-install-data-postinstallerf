The package enables the author to create acronyms in a simple
way, and provides means to add them to different classes of
acronyms. Lists can be created of separate acronym classes. The
package option single instructs the package to ignore
acronyms that are used only once in the whole document. As an
experimental feature the package also offers the option sort
which automatically sorts the list created by \printacronyms.

KMahjongg is a tile matching game for one or two players, a variation
usually known as Mahjong Solitaire.  In KMahjongg the tiles are scrambled
and stacked on top of each other to resemble a certain shape. The player
is then expected to remove all the tiles off the game board by locating
each tiles matching pair.

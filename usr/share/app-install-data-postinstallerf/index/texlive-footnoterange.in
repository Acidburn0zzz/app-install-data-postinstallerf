The package provides environments footnoterange and
footnoterange*. Multiple footnotes inside these environments
are not referenced as (e.g.) "1 2 3 4" but as "1-4", i.e., the
range (from first to last referred footnote at that place) is
given. If hyperref package and use of its hyperfootnotes-option
the references are hyperlinked. (References to footnotes in the
footnoterange* environment are never hyperlinked.)

normalize-package-data exports a function that normalizes package metadata. This
data is typically found in a package.json file, but in principle could come from
any source - for example the npm registry.

normalize-package-data is used by read-package-json to normalize the data it
reads from a package.json file. In turn, read-package-json is used by npm and
various npm-related tools.

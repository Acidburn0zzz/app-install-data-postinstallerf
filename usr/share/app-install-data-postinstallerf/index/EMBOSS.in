EMBOSS is a new, free Open Source software analysis package specially
developed for the needs of the molecular biology (e.g. EMBnet) user community.
The software automatically copes with data in a variety of formats and even
allows transparent retrieval of sequence data from the web. Also, as extensive
libraries are provided with the package, it is a platform to allow other
scientists to develop and release software in true open source spirit.
EMBOSS also integrates a range of currently available packages and tools for
sequence analysis into a seamless whole.

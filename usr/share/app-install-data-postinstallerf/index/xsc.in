The object is to blast a hole in the rings and destroy the enemy ship.
The only problem is that it tracks your every move and as soon as you
knock a hole in all three rings, and they all line up, it lets loose
with the big nasty green fireballs.  Avoid them.  Avoid the little green
buzzers, too.  Shoot em if you want.

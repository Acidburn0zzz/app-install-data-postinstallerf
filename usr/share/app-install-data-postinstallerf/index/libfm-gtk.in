libfm is a GIO-based library used to develop file manager-like programs. It is
developed as the core of next generation PCManFM and takes care of all file-
related operations such as copy & paste, drag & drop, file associations or
thumbnail support. By utilizing glib/gio and gvfs, libfm can access remote
file systems supported by gvfs.

This package provides useful file manager-related GTK+ widgets.

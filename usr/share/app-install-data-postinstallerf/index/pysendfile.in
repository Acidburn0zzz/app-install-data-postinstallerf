Comment3='
sendfile(2) is a system call which provides a "zero-copy" way of copying data
from one file descriptor to another (a socket). The phrase "zero-copy" refers
to the fact that all of the copying of data between the two descriptors is done
entirely by the kernel, with no copying of data into user-space buffers. This is
particularly useful when sending a file over a socket (e.g. FTP).

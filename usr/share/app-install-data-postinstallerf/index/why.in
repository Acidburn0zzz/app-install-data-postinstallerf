Why is a software verification platform that applies formal proving
tools to annotated programs.  It is currently capable of analysis of C
(through "Frama-C"), Java (through the included tool "Krakatoa"), and
potentially ML programs with some modification into Whys own ML-like
language.  Furthermore, Why is capable of analysis of any program that
is mapped onto its own internal language.  It uses a weakest
precondition involving calculus to generate potential theorems necessary
for the proof of a programs correctness.  It translates these theorems
into formats that can be used by external proof assistants (without any
extra work Coq, PVS, HOL Light, and Mizar are supported - having one is

dvd-slideshow is a group of Linux commandline programs that create a
slideshow style dvd from groups of pictures. Slideshow videos can be made from
a directory or some online photo albums. You can add fancy effects like fades,
titles, and the Kenburns effect (slowly zooming and panning at the same time)
along with audio to make your slideshows even nicer. There is also a script
which generates a menu for your dvd (dvd-menu).

git-bz is a tool for integrating the Git command line with the
Bugzilla bug-tracking system. Operations such as attaching patches to
bugs, applying patches in bugs to your current tree, and closing bugs
once youve pushed the fixes publicly can be done completely from the
command line without having to go to your web browser.

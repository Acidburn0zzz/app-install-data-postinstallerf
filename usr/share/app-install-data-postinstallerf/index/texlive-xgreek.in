Comment3='
This package has been designed so to allow people to typeset
Greek language documents using XeLaTeX. And it is released in
the hope that people will use it and spot errors, bugs,
features so to improve it. Practically, it provides all the
capabilities of the greek option of the babel package. The
package can be invoked with any of the following options
monotonic (for typesetting modern monotonic Greek), polytonic
(for typesetting modern polytonic Greek), and ancient (for
typesetting ancient texts). The default option is monotonic.
The command \setlanguage{<lang>} to activate the hyphenation

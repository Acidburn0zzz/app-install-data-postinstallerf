The QWizard module allows script authors to concentrate on the
content of the forms they want their users to fill in without
worrying about the display.  It allows "Question Wizard" like
interfaces to be very easily created and the results of the input
easily acted upon.  Scripts written which are entirely based on
QWizard inputs are able to be run from the command line which will
show a Gtk2, Tk window or as a ReadLine interactive session or as a
CGI script without modification.  Script writers do not need to know
which interface is being used to display the resulting form(s) as it
should be transparent to the script itself.

also constructs and prints out for the user the list of environment
variables using the syntax appropriate for the users current shell (as
specified by the SHELL environment variable), suitable for directly
adding to ones shell configuration file.

directory containing Perl modules outside of Perls @INC. This makes
it easier to ship an application with an app-specific copy of a Perl module,

CIReporter is an add-on to TestUnit, RSpec and Cucumber that allows you to
generate XML reports of your test, spec and/or feature runs. The resulting
files can be read by a continuous integration system that understands Ants
JUnit report XML format, thus allowing your CI system to track test/spec
successes and failures.

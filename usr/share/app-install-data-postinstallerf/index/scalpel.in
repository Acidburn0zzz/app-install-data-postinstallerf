Scalpel is a fast file carver that reads a database of header and footer
definitions and extracts matching files from a set of image files or raw
device files. Scalpel is independent on used file-system and will carve
files from FATx, NTFS, ext2/3, or raw partitions. It is useful for both
digital forensics investigation and file recovery.

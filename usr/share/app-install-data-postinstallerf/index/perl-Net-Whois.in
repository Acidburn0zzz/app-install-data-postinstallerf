Comment3='
NetWhoisDomain new() attempts to retrieve and parse the given
domains "whois" information from the InterNIC (whois.internic.net). If
the server could not be contacted, is too busy, or otherwise does not
process the query then the constructor does not return a reference and
your object is undefined. If the constructor returns a reference, that
reference can be used to access the various attributes of the domains
whois entry assuming that there was a match. The member function ok
returns 1 if a match 0 if no match.

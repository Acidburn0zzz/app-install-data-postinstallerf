Atraci is an application for Windows, Mac and Linux that lets you listen
instantly to more than 60 million songs (way more than iTuness 26 million).
It requires no sign up, displays no ads and is 100% safe.

We believe that listening to music should always be free and available to
everyone, and that only owning it should bear a cost.

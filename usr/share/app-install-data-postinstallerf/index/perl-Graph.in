This is Graph, a Perl module for dealing with graphs, the abstract
data structures.

This is a full rewrite of the Graph module 0.2xx series as discussed
in the book "Mastering Algorithms with Perl", written by Jarkko
Hietaniemi (the undersigned), John Macdonald, and Jon Orwant,
and published by OReilly and Associates.  This rewrite is not
fully compatible with the 0.2xx series.

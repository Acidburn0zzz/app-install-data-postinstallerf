Comment3='
Provides support for the manipulation and reference of small or
sub figures and tables within a single figure or table
environment. It is convenient to use this package when your
subfigures are to be separately captioned, referenced, or are
to be included in the List-of-Figures. A new \subfigure command
is introduced which can be used inside a figure environment for
each subfigure. An optional first argument is used as the
caption for that subfigure. This package is now obsolescent
new users should use subfig instead.

Raidem is a 2d top-down shootem up. It began as a remake of Raid II
(abandoned long ago), but has turned out very differently.
Features Neat looking graphics, LOTS of explosions and scrap
metal, Eye candy a-plenty, Many different powerups, A desert. And a space
platform. And some snow, 2 player mode, Demo recording and playback, Loads of
fun.

Comment3='
The LinuxTV dvb-apps package contains some Linux DVB API applications and a set
of utilities that both the developer and end user alike will find quite useful.
Specifically, the utilities are geared towards the initial setup, testing, and
operation of a DVB device, whether it be of the software decoding or hardware
decoding type.

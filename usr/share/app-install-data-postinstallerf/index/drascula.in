You play the role of John Hacker, a British estate agent, who travels to a
small village of Transylvania in order to negotiate the sale of some ground
of Gibraltar with the Count Drascula.
But unfortunately Hacker is not aware of who is Drascula in reality the most
terrible vampire with just one idea on his mind DOMINATING the World
demonstrating that he is even more evil than his brother Vlad.

Notice that music for the game is available as an addon in the separate
drascula-music package. As are Spanish, German, French and Italian subtitles
in the drascula-international package.

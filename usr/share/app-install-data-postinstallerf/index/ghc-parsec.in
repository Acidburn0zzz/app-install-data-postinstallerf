Parsec is designed from scratch as an industrial-strength parser library.
It is simple, safe, well documented (on the package homepage), has extensive
libraries and good error messages, and is also fast. It is defined as a monad
transformer that can be stacked on arbitrary monads, and it is also parametric
in the input stream type.

Osmo is a handy personal organizer which includes calendar, tasks manager and
address book modules. It was designed to be a small, easy to use and good
looking PIM tool to help to manage personal information. In current state the
organizer is quite convenient in use - for example, user can perform nearly
all operations using keyboard. Also, a lot of parameters are configurable to
meet user preferences.

schroot allows users to execute commands or interactive shells in
different chroots.  Any number of named chroots may be created, and
access permissions given to each, including root access for normal
users, on a per-user or per-group basis.  Additionally, schroot can
switch to a different user in the chroot, using PAM for
authentication and authorisation.  All operations are logged for
security.

Several different types of chroot are supported, including normal
directories in the filesystem, and also block devices.  Sessions,

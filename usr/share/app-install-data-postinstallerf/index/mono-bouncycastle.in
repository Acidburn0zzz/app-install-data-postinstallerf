The Bouncy Castle Crypto package is a C# implementation of cryptographic
algorithms. It is a port of the Bouncy Castle Java APIs, with
approximately 80% of the functionality ported. The C# API is constantly
kept up to date with bug fixes and new test cases from the Java build
(and vice versa sometimes), thus benefiting from the large user base
and real-world use the Java version has seen.

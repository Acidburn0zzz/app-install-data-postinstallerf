Comment3='
This package provides several functions to quickly
search for substrings in strict or lazy ByteStrings.
It also provides functions for breaking or splitting
on substrings and replacing all occurrences of a
substring (the first in case of overlaps) with another.
GHC before 6.10 are no longer supported, other compilers
only if they support BangPatterns. If you need it to
work with other compilers, send a feature request.

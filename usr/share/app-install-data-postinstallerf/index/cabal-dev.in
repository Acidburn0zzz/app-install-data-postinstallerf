cabal-dev is a tool for managing development builds of Haskell projects.
It supports maintaining sandboxed cabal-install repositories,
and sandboxed ghc package databases.

By default, it uses a cabal-dev directory under the current working directory
as the sandbox.
For most packages, just use cabal-dev instead of cabal, and you will get
a sandboxed build that will not install anything (even automatically installed
dependencies) into the user or global ghc package databases.

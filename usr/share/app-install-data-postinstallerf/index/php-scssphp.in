SCSS (http//sass-lang.com/) is a CSS preprocessor that adds many features like
variables, mixins, imports, color manipulation, functions, and tons of other
powerful features.

The entire compiler comes in a single class file ready for including in any kind
of project in addition to a command line tool for running the compiler from the
terminal.
scssphp implements SCSS (3.2.12). It does not implement the SASS syntax, only
the SCSS syntax.

Comment3='
METAOBJ is a large metapost package providing high-level
objects. It implements many of PSTricks features for node
connections, but also trees, matrices, and many other things.
It more or less contains boxes.mp and rboxes.mp. There is a
large (albeit not complete) documentation distributed with the
package. It is easily extensible with new objects.

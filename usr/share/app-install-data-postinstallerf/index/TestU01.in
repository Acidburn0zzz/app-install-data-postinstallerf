TestU01 is a software library, implemented in the ANSI C language, and offering
a collection of utilities for the empirical statistical testing of uniform
random number generators.

The library implements several types of random number generators in generic
form, as well as many specific generators proposed in the literature or found
in widely-used software. It provides general implementations of the classical
statistical tests for random number generators, as well as several others
proposed in the literature, and some original ones. These tests can be applied
to the generators predefined in the library and to user-defined generators.

Comment3='
Parser and writer for handling sectioned config files in
Haskell.

The ConfigFile module works with configuration files in a
standard format that is easy for the user to edit, easy for
the programmer to work with, yet remains powerful and
flexible. It is inspired by, and compatible with, Pythons
ConfigParser module. It uses files that resemble Windows
.INI-style files, but with numerous improvements.

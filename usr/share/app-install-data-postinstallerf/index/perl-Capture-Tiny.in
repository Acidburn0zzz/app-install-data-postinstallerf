Comment3='
CaptureTiny provides a simple, portable way to capture anything sent to
STDOUT or STDERR, regardless of whether it comes from Perl, from XS code or
from an external program. Optionally, output can be teed so that it is
captured while being passed through to the original handles. Yes, it even
works on Windows. Stop guessing which of a dozen capturing modules to use
in any particular situation and just use this one.

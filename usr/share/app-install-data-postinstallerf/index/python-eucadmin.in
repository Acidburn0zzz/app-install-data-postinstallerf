Eucalyptus is a service overlay that implements elastic computing
using existing resources. The goal of Eucalyptus is to allow sites
with existing clusters and server infrastructure to co-host an elastic
computing service that is interface-compatible with Amazon AWS.

This package contains the Python library used by Eucalyptus administration
tools.  It is neither intended nor supported for use by any other programs.

Kubrick is a puzzle cube solving game. The cube sizes range from
2x2x2 (easy) up to 6x6x6 (very hard), or you can play with irregular
?bricks? such as 5x3x2 and ?mats? (one cubie thick) such
as 6x4x1. The game has a selection of puzzles at several levels of
difficulty, as well as some demonstrations of pretty patterns and solution
moves. It is also possible to make up your own puzzles.

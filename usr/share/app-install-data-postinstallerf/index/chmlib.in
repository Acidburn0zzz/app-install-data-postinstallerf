CHMLIB is a library for dealing with ITSS/CHM format files. Right now, it is
a very simple library, but sufficient for dealing with all of the .chm files
Ive come across. Due to the fairly well-designed indexing built into this
particular file format, even a small library is able to gain reasonably good
performance indexing into ITSS archives.

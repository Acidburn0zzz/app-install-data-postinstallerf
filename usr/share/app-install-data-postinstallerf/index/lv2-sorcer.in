Sorcer is a polyphonic wavetable synth LV2 plugin. Its sonic fingerprint is
one of harsh modulated sub-bass driven walls of sound. Two morphing wavetable
oscillators and one sine oscillator provide the generation routines. The LFO
can be mapped to wavetable modulation as well as filter cutoff. An ADSR allows
for shaping the resulting sound, while a master volume finishes the signal
chain. Easily creating a variety of dubstep basslines and harsh pad sounds.

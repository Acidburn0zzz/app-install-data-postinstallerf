This package contains textfiles that are shared between the applications of the
freemedforms suite such as freemedforms, freediams, freeaccount, freeicd,
freepad, freetoolbox

All applications of the suite should require this package when they are
packaged for Fedora instead of re-generating these files. See the freediams
package for hints on how to do this.

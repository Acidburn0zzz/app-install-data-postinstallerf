Comment3='
Resapplet is a simple utility that sits in the system notification area
and allows switching the resolution and refresh rate.  It uses the
xrandr extensions to switch the resolution on-the-fly and user
resolution preferences to save the resolution.

It works in both GNOME and KDE, because it uses the system notification
area.

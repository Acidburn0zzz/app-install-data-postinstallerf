Teseq, a tool for analyzing files that contain control characters and
terminal control sequences. It is intended to be useful for diagnosing
terminal emulators, and programs that make heavy use of terminal features
(such as those based on the Curses library).

It is primarily targeted at individuals who possess a basic understanding of
terminal control sequences, especially CSI sequences.

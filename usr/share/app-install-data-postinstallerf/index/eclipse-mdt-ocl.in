OCL is an implementation of the Object Constraint Language (OCL) OMG standard
for EMF-based models. The objectives of the OCL component are to provide APIs
for parsing and evaluating OCL constraints and queries on EMF models, an Ecore
implementation of the OCL abstract syntax model, including support for
serialization of parsed OCL expressions, a Visitor API for analyzing/
transforming the AST model of OCL expressions and an extensibility API for
clients to customize the parsing and evaluation environments used by the
parser.

MIME types are used in many applications, for instance as part of e-mail
and HTTP traffic, to indicate the type of content that is transmitted.

Sometimes detailed knowledge about a mime-type is need; however, this
module only knows about the file-name extensions that relate to some
file-type.  It can also be used to produce the right format types that
are not registered at IANA need to use x- prefixes.

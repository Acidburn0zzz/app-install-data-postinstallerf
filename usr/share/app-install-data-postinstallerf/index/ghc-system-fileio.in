Comment3='
This is a small wrapper around the "directory", "unix", and "Win32" packages,
for use with "system-filepath". It provides a consistent API to the various
versions of these packages distributed with different versions of GHC.

In particular, this library supports working with POSIX files that have paths
which cant be decoded in the current locale encoding.

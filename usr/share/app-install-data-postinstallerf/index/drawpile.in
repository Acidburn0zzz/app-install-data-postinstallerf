DrawPile is a sketching oriented drawing program with a twist:
you can share your drawing live with other users.
There are no restrictions on who may draw where; every user has
full access to the whole picture simultaneously.

Feature highlights:
    * Antialiased drawing and multiple blending modes
    * Layers
    * Text annotations
    * Tablet pressure sensitivity
    * Image may be rotated freely while drawing
    * Built-in server for hosting shared sessions
    * Chat

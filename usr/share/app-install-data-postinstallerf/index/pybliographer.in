Pybliographer is a tool for managing bibliographic databases. It can be
used for searching, editing, reformatting, etc. In fact, its a simple
framework that provides easy to use python classes and functions, and
therefore can be extended to many uses (generating HTML pages according
to bibliographic searches, etc).
In addition to the scripting environment, a graphical Gnome interface
is available. It provides powerful editing capabilities, a nice
hierarchical search mechanism, direct insertion of references into LyX,
direct queries on Medline, and more. It currently supports the following
file formats BibTeX, ISI, Medline, Ovid, Refer.

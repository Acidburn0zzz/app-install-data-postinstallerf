Comment3='
FOP is the worlds first print formatter driven by XSL formatting
objects. It is a Java application that reads a formatting object tree
and then turns it into a PDF document. The formatting object tree, can
be in the form of an XML document (output by an XSLT engine like XT or
Xalan) or can be passed in memory as a DOM Document or (in the case of
XT) SAX events.

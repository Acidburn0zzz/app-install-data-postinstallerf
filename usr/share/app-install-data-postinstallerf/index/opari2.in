OPARI2 is a source-to-source instrumentation tool for OpenMP and hybrid
codes.  It surrounds OpenMP directives and runtime library calls with calls
to the POMP2 measurement interface.

OPARI2 will provide you with a new initialization method that allows for
multi-directory and parallel builds as well as the usage of pre-instrumented
libraries. Furthermore, an efficient way of tracking parent-child
relationships was added. Additionally, we extended OPARI2 to support
instrumentation of OpenMP 3.0 tied tasks.

The unzip utility is used to list, test, or extract files from a zip
archive.  Zip archives are commonly found on MS-DOS systems.  The zip
utility, included in the zip package, creates zip archives.  Zip and
unzip are both compatible with archives created by PKWARE(R)s PKZIP
for MS-DOS, but the programs options and default behaviors do differ
in some respects.

Install the unzip package if you need to list, test or extract files from
a zip archive.

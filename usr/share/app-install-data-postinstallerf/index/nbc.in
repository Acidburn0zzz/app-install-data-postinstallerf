Next Byte Codes (NBC) is a simple language with an assembly language
syntax that can be used to program LEGOs NXT programmable brick
(from the new LEGO Mindstorms NXT set).

Not Exactly C (NXC) is a high level language, similar to C, built on
top of the NBC compiler. It can also be used to program the NXT brick.
NXC is basically NQC (Not Quite C) for the NXT.

Pynac is a derivative of the C++ library GiNaC, which allows manipulation of
symbolic expressions. It currently provides the backend for symbolic
expressions in Sage.

The main difference between Pynac and GiNaC is that Pynac relies on Sage to
provide the operations on numerical types, while GiNaC depends on CLN for this
purpose.

Comment3='
The gnu.regexp package is a pure-Java implementation of a traditional
(non-POSIX) NFA regular expression engine. Its syntax can emulate many
popular development tools, including awk, sed, emacs, perl and grep. For
a relatively complete list of supported and non-supported syntax, refer
to the syntax and usage notes.

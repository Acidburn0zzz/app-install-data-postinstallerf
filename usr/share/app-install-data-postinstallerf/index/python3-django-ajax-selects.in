Enables editing of ForeignKey, ManyToMany and simple text fields using the
Autocomplete - jQuery plugin.
django-ajax-selects will work in any normal form as well as in the admin.
The user is presented with a text field. They type a search term or a few
letters of a name they are looking for, an ajax request is sent to the server,
a search channel returns possible results. Results are displayed as a drop
down menu. When an item is selected it is added to a display area just below
the text field.

Libquicktime is based on the quicktime4linux library with several
enhancements. All 3rd-party libraries were removed from the
sourcetree. Instead, the systemwide installed libraries are detected
by the configure script. All original codecs were moved into
dynamically loadable modules, and new codecs are in
development. Libquicktime is source-compatible with
quicktime4linux. Special API extensions allow access to the codec
registry and more convenient processing of Audio and Video
data.

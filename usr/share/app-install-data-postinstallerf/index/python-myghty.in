Comment3='
Myghty is a Python based web and templating framework originally based on
HTMLMason, the enterprise-level framework used by Amazon.com, del.icio.us
and Salon.com, among many others. Myghty fully implements Masons templating
language, component-based architecture, and caching system, and goes beyond,
adding new paradigms such the Module Components controller paradigm, full
Python whitespace syntax, threading support, WSGI support, session support,
and much more.

Gnaural is a multi-platform programmable binaural-beat generator. It
is actually brainwave entrainment software for creating binaural beats
intended to be used as personal brainwave synchronization software,
for scientific research, or by professionals. Gnaural allows for the
creation of binaural beat tracks specifying different frequencies and
exporting tracks into different audio formats. Gnaural runnings can
also be linked over the internet, allowing synchronous sessions
between many users.

NCID is Caller ID (CID) distributed over a network to a variety of
devices and computers.  NCID includes a server, gateways, a client,
and client output modules.

The NCID server obtains the Caller ID information from a serial device,
like a modem, and from VOIP and YAC gateways.
This package contains the server and gateways.  The client is in the
ncid-client package.

tcptrack is a sniffer which displays information about TCP connections
it sees on a network interface. It passively watches for connections on
the network interface, keeps track of their state and displays a list of
connections in a manner similar to the unix top command. It displays
source and destination addresses and ports, connection state, idle time,
and bandwidth usage

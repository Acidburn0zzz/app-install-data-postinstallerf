vehicles and eliminate your enemy using the whole arsenal of weapons. has
original cartoon-like graphics and cool music, it is fun and dynamic, it has
several network modes for deathmatch and cooperative.
What else is needed to have fun with your friends?

And all is packed and ready for you in Battle Tanks.

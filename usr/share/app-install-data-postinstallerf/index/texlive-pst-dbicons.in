Comment3='
The package provides some useful macros in the database area.
The package focusses on typesetting ER-Diagrams in a
declarative style, i.e., by positioning some nodes and defining
the position of all other nodes relative to them by using the
standard database terminology. The PSTricks package is required
for using pst-dbicons, but no deep knowledge of PSTricks
commands is required (although such knowledge is useful for
exploiting the full functionality of the package).

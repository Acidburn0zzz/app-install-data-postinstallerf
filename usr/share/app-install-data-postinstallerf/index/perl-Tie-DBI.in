This distribution contains TieDBI and TieRDBM, two modules that
allow you to tie associative arrays to relational databases using the
DBI library.  The hash is tied to a table in a local or networked
database.  Reading from the hash retrieves values from the database.
Storing into the hash updates the database (if you have sufficient
privileges).

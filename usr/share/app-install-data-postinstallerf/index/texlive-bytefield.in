The bytefield package helps the user create illustrations for
network protocol specifications and anything else that utilizes
fields of data. These illustrations show how the bits and bytes
are laid out in a packet or in memory. Users should note that
the present version 2.0 offers a different (and incompatible)
user interface from earlier versions.

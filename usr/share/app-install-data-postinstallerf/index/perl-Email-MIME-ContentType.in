Comment3='
This module is responsible for parsing email content type headers according
to section 5.1 of RFC 2045. It returns a hash with entries for the type, the
subtype, and a hash of attributes.

For backward compatibility with a really unfortunate misunderstanding of RFC
2045 by the early implementors of this module, discrete and composite are
also present in the returned hashref, with the values of type and subtype
respectively.

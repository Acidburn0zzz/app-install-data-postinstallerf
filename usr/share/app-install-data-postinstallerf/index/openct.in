OpenCT implements drivers for several smart card readers.  It comes as
driver in ifdhandler format for PC/SC-Lite, as CT-API driver, or as a
small and lean middleware, so applications can use it with minimal
overhead.  OpenCT also has a primitive mechanism to export smart card
readers to remote machines via TCP/IP.

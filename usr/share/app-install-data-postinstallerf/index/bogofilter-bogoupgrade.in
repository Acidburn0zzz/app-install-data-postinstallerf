bogoupgrade is a command to upgrade bogofilter?s databases from an old
format to the current format. Since the format of the database changes
once in a while, the utility is designed to make the upgrade easy.

bogoupgrade is in an extra package to remove the perl dependency on the
main bogofilter package.

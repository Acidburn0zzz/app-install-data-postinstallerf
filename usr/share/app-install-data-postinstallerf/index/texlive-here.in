Comment3='
Provides the H option for floats in LaTeX to signify that the
environemt is not really a float (and should therefore be
placed "here" and not float at all). The package emulates an
older package of the same name, which has long been been
suppressed by its author. The job is done by nothing more than
loading the float package, which has long provided the option
in an acceptable framework.

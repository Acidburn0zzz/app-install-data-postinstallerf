While the perldoc/tie manpage allows tying to an arbitrary object, the
class in question must support this in its implementation of TIEHASH,
TIEARRAY or whatever.

This class provides a very tie constructor that simply returns the object
it was given as its first argument.
This way side effects of calling $object->TIEHASH are avoided.

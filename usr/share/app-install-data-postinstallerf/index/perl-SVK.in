SVK is a decentralized version control system written in Perl. It uses
the Subversion file system but provides additional features

    * Offline operations like check-in, log, merge.
    * Distributed branches.
    * Lightweight checkout copy management (no .svn directories).
    * Advanced merge algorithms, like star-merge and cherry picking.

SONATA stands for "systems of nearrings and their applications".  It
provides methods for the construction and the analysis of finite
nearrings.  A left nearring is an algebra (N;+,*), where (N,+) is a (not
necessarily abelian) group, (N,*) is a semigroup, and x*(y+z) = x*y + x*z
holds for all x,y,z in N.

As a typical example of a nearring, we may consider the set of all
mappings from a group G into G, where the addition is the pointwise
addition of mappings in G, and the multiplication is composition of
functions.  If functions are written on the right of their arguments,

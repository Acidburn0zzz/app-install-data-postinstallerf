Gnofract 4D is a free, open source program which allows anyone to create
beautiful images called fractals.  The images are automatically created
by the computer based on mathematical principles.  These include the
Mandelbrot and Julia sets and many more.  You dont need to do any math
you can explore a universe of images just using a mouse.

Virtual Hybridization uses sets of short probes to generate datasets
for comparative genomics given a DNA sequence and a set of probes,
the typical output will give a sequence of oriented probe hits along
the DNA sequence. Other tools are supplied to allow simple manipulations
such as format conversion and extraction of permutations.

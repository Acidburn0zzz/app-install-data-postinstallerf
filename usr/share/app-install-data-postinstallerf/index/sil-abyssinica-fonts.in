SIL Abyssinica is a Unicode typeface family containing glyphs for the
Ethiopic script.

The Ethiopic script is used for writing many of the languages of Ethiopia and
Eritrea. Abyssinica SIL supports all Ethiopic characters which are in Unicode
including the Unicode 4.1 extensions. Some languages of Ethiopia are not yet
able to be fully represented in Unicode and, where necessary, we have included
non-Unicode characters in the Private Use Area (see Private-use (PUA)
characters supported by Abyssinica SIL).

Comment3='
Functions for fitting general continuous-time Markov and hidden Markov
multi-state models to longitudinal data.  Both Markov transition rates
and the hidden Markov output process can be modelled in terms of
covariates.  A variety of observation schemes are supported, including
processes observed at arbitrary times, completely-observed processes,
and censored states.

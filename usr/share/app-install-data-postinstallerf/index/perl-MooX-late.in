Moo is a light-weight object oriented programming framework which aims to
be compatible with Moose. It does this by detecting when Moose has been
loaded, and automatically "inflating" its classes and roles to full Moose
classes and roles. This way, Moo classes can consume Moose roles, Moose
classes can extend Moo classes, and so forth.

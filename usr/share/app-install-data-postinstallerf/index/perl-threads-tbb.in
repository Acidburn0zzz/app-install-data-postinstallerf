Comment3='
This module provides access to a few core TBB API functions to Perl programs.
The algorithms employed by TBB are quite different to threads as provided by
"use threads;" - instead of directly starting threads and managing their
activity and communication/synchronization, an API is provided that provides
data parallelism.

Parcellite is a stripped down, basic-features-only clipboard manager with a
small memory footprint for those who like simplicity.

In GNOME and Xfce the clipboard manager will be started automatically. For
other desktops or window managers you should also install a panel with a
system tray or notification area if you want to use this package.

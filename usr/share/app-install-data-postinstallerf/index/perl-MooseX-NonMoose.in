Comment3='
MooseXNonMoose allows for easily subclassing non-Moose classes with
Moose, taking care of the annoying details connected with doing this, such
as setting up proper inheritance from MooseObject and installing (and
inlining, at make_immutable time) a constructor that makes sure things like
BUILD methods are called. It tries to be as non-intrusive as possible -
when this module is used, inheriting from non-Moose classes and inheriting
from Moose classes should work identically, aside from the few caveats
mentioned below. One of the goals of this module is that including it in a
MooseExporter-based package used across an entire application should be
possible, without interfering with classes that only inherit from Moose

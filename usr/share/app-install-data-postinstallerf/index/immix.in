Immix alignes and averages a set of similar images,
 thereby decreasing the numerical noise. It is especially
 useful with digital cameras images shot in a low light
 environment multiple noisy, high-ISO setting images
 can be combined to get a single less noisy, low-ISO-like
 image, without the blur typically associated with low-ISO
 (motion during exposure) or noise reduction algorithms.

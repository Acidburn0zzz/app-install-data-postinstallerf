WritRecogn recognizes East Asian handwritten characters for
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK). Unlike some implementations
which require to build a huge set of character recognition rules,
we recognize radicals of Chinese characters, i.e. the word root
of the character,then use a character-structure-based input method
to search for the word. This saves us from writing recognition rules
for tens of thousands of CJK characters. This should provide better
recognition accuracy than current open source handwriting
recognition libraries.

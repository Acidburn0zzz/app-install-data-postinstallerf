Comment3='
OpenGFX is an open source graphics base set for OpenTTD which can completely
replace the TTD base set. The main goal of OpenGFX therefore is to provide a
set of free base graphics which make it possible to play OpenTTD without
requiring the (copyrighted) files from the TTD CD. This potentially increases
the OpenTTD fan base and makes it a true free game (with "free" as in both
"free beer" and "free speech").

As of version 0.2.0 OpenGFX has a full set of sprites. Future versions will aim
to improve the graphics.

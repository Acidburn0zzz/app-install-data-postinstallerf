SBinary is a library for describing binary protocols, in the form of
mappings between Scala types and binary formats. It can be used as a
robust serialization mechanism for Scala objects or a way of dealing
with existing binary formats found in the wild.
It started out life as a loose port of Haskells Data.Binary. Its
since evolved a bit from there to take advantage of the features Scala
implicits offer over Haskell type classes, but the core idea has
remained the same.

Comment3='
Daredevil SKK is a branch of SKK (Simple Kana to Kanji conversion program,
an input method of Japanese). It forked from the maintrunk, SKK version 10.56.
It consists of a simple core and many optional programs which provide extensive
features, however, our target is to more simplify core, and more expand its
optional features.

This package does not include dictionaries or a skkserver. Please install them
separately.

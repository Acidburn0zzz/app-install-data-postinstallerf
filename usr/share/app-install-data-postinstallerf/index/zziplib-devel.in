Comment3='
The zziplib library is intentionally lightweight, it offers the ability to
easily extract data from files archived in a single zip file. Applications
can bundle files into a single zip archive and access them. The implementation
is based only on the (free) subset of compression with the zlib algorithm
which is actually used by the zip/unzip tools.

This package contains files required to build applications that will use the
zziplib library.

Comment3='
PerlCritic is primarily used as a static source code analyzer, which means
that it never compiles or executes any of the code that it examines. But
since Perl is a dynamic language, there are certain types of problems that
cannot be discovered until the code is actually compiled.

This distribution includes PerlCriticDynamicPolicy, which can be used as
a base class for Policies that wish to compile the code they analyze.

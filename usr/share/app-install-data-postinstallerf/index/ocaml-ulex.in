Ulex is an OCaml lexer generator for Unicode

- ulex is a lexer generator.
- it is implemented as an OCaml syntax extension
  lexer specifications are embedded in regular OCaml code.
- the lexers work with a new kind of "lexbuf" that supports Unicode;
  a single lexer can work with arbitrary encodings of the input stream.

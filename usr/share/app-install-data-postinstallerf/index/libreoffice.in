LibreOffice is an Open Source, community-developed, office productivity suite.
It includes the key desktop applications, such as a word processor,
spreadsheet, presentation manager, formula editor and drawing program, with a
user interface and feature set similar to other office suites.  Sophisticated
and flexible, LibreOffice also works transparently with a variety of file
formats, including Microsoft Office File Formats.

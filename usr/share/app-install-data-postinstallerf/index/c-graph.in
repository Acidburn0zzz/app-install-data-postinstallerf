GNU C-Graph is a novel tool for visualizing the mathematical operation
of convolution underlying natural phenomena susceptible to analysis in
terms of engineering signals and systems theory. "C-Graph" is an
abbreviation for "Convolution Graph". The package is derived from the
BSc. Honors dissertation in Electrical Engineering "Interactive
Computer Package Demonstrating Sampling Convolution and the FFT",
Adrienne Gaye Thompson, University of Aberdeen (1983).

The package computes the linear convolution of two signals in the time
domain then compares their circular convolution by demonstrating the

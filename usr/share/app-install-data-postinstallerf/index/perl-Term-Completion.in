TermCompletion is an extensible, highly configurable replacement for
the venerable TermComplete package. It is object-oriented and thus allows
subclassing. Two derived classes are TermCompletionMulti and
TermCompletionPath. A prompt is printed and the user may enter one line
of input, submitting the answer by pressing the ENTER key.

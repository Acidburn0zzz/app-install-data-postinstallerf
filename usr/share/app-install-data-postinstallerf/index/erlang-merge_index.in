MergeIndex is an Erlang library for storing ordered sets on disk. It is very
similar to an SSTable (in Googles Bigtable) or an HFile (in Hadoop).

Basho Technologies developed MergeIndex to serve as the underlying index storage
format for Riak Search and the upcoming Secondary Index functionality in Riak.

SSH key-based authentication is tried-and-true, but it lacks a true
Public Key Infrastructure for key certification, revocation and
expiration.  Monkeysphere is a framework that uses the OpenPGP web of
trust for these PKI functions.  It can be used in both directions for
users to get validated host keys, and for hosts to authenticate users.

Comment='<span size="xx-large">JSON pretty-printing library</span>'
Comment3='
A JSON pretty-printing library compatible with aeson as well as a command-line
tool to improve readabilty of streams of JSON data.

The library provides the function "encodePretty". It is a drop-in replacement
for aesons "encode" function, producing JSON-ByteStrings for human readers.
The command-line tool reads JSON from stdin and writes prettified JSON to
stdout. It also offers a complementary "compact"-mode, essentially the opposite
of pretty-printing.

MySQL++ is a C++ wrapper for MySQL?s C API.

It is built around STL principles, to make dealing with the database as easy
as dealing with an STL container. MySQL++ relieves the programmer of dealing
with cumbersome C data structures, generation of repetitive SQL statements,
and manual creation of C++ data structures to mirror the database schema.
If you are building your own MySQL++-based programs, you also need
to install the -devel package.

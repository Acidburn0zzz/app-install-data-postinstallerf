Comment3='
XML Builder is a utility that creates simple XML documents using relatively
sparse Java code.

It is intended to allow for quick and painless creation of XML documents
where you might otherwise be tempted to use concatenated strings, and
where you would rather not face the tedium and verbosity of coding with JAXP.

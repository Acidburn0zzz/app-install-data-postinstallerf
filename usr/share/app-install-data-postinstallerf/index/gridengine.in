Comment3='
In a typical network that does not have distributed resource management
software, workstations and servers are used from 5% to 20% of the time.
Even technical servers are generally less than fully utilized. This
means that there are a lot of cycles that can be used productively if
only users know where they are, can capture them, and put them to work.

Grid Engine finds a pool of idle resources and harnesses it
productively, so an organization gets as much as five to ten times the
usable power out of systems on the network. That can increase utilization
to as much as 98%.

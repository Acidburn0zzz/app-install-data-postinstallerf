Comment3='
Idle3-tools provides a linux/unix utility that can disable, get and set the
value of the infamous idle3 timer found on recent Western Digital Hard Disk
Drives.  It can be used as an alternative to the official wdidle3.exe
proprietary utility, without the need to reboot in a DOS environement.  A power
off/on cycle of the drive will still be mandatory for new settings to be taken
into account.

Idle3-tools is an independant project, unrelated in any way to Western Digital Corp.
WARNING THIS SOFTWARE IS EXPERIMENTAL AND NOT WELL TESTED. IT ACCESSES LOW
LEVEL INFORMATION OF YOUR HARDDRIVE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

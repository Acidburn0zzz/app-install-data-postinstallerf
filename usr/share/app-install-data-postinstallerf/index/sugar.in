Sugar provides simple yet powerful means of engaging young children in the
world of learning that is opened up by computers and the Internet. With Sugar,
even the youngest learner will quickly become proficient in using the
computer as a tool to engage in authentic problem-solving.  Sugar promotes
sharing, collaborative learning, and reflection, developing skills that help
them in all aspects of life.

Sugar is also the learning environment for the One Laptop Per Child project.

Xtables-addons provides extra modules for iptables not present in the kernel,
and is the successor of patch-o-matic. Extensions includes new targets like
TEE, TARPIT, CHAOS, or modules like geoip, ipset, and account.

This package provides the userspace libraries for iptables to use extensions
in the xtables-addons-kmod package. You must also install the
xtables-addons-kmod package.

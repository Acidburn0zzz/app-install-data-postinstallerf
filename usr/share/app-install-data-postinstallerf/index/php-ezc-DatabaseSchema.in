The DatabaseSchema component provides a unified data structure to describe
relational databases. DatabaseSchema can read and write the structure from and
to several databases (such as MySQL, SQLite and Oracle) and also read and write
in two web language files (XML and PHP).

The main intention of the component is to extract an already existing schema
from a database, and compare it with either a predefined schema to check for
any changes. Although the component does allow you to create the schema manually
through the API, it is often easier to create the schema yourself in a database,
and then extract the data from it.

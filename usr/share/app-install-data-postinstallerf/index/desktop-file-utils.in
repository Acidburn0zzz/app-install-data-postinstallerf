.desktop files are used to describe an application for inclusion in
GNOME or KDE menus.  This package contains desktop-file-validate which
checks whether a .desktop file complies with the specification at
http//www.freedesktop.org/standards/, and desktop-file-install
which installs a desktop file to the standard directory, optionally
fixing it up in the process.

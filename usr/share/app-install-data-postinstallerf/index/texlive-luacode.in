Comment3='
Executing Lua code from within TeX with directlua can sometimes
be tricky there is no easy way to use the percent character,
counting backslashes may be hard, and Lua comments dont work
the way you expect. The package provides the \luaexec command
and the luacode(*) environments to help with these problems.

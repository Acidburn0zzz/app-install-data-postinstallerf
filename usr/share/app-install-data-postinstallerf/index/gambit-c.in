Gambit-C includes a Scheme interpreter and a Scheme compiler which can
be used to build standalone executables.  Because the compiler
generates portable C code it is fairly easy to port to any platform
with a decent C compiler.

The Gambit-C system conforms to the R4RS, R5RS and IEEE Scheme
standards.  The full numeric tower is implemented, including infinite
precision integers (bignums), rationals, inexact reals (floating point
numbers), and complex numbers.

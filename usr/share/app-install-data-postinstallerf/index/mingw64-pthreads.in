The POSIX 1003.1-2001 standard defines an application programming
interface (API) for writing multithreaded applications. This interface
is known more commonly as pthreads. A good number of modern operating
systems include a threading library of some kind Solaris (UI)
threads, Win32 threads, DCE threads, DECthreads, or any of the draft
revisions of the pthreads standard. The trend is that most of these
systems are slowly adopting the pthreads standard API, with
application developers following suit to reduce porting woes.

Win32 does not, and is unlikely to ever, support pthreads

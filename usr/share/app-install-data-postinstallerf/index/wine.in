Wine as a compatibility layer for UNIX to run Windows applications. This
package includes a program loader, which allows unmodified Windows
3.x/9x/NT binaries to run on x86 and x86_64 Unixes. Wine can use native system
.dll files if they are available.

In Fedora wine is a meta-package which will install everything needed for wine
to work smoothly. Smaller setups can be achieved by installing some of the
wine-* sub packages.

Sawfish is an extensible window manager which uses a Lisp-based
scripting language.  All window decorations are configurable and the
basic idea is to have as much user-interface policy as possible
controlled through the Lisp language.  Configuration can be
accomplished by writing Lisp code in a personal .sawfishrc file, or
using a GTK+ interface.  Sawfish is mostly GNOME compliant

MATE Sensors Applet is an applet for the MATE Panel to display readings
from hardware sensors, including CPU and system temperatures, fan speeds
and voltage readings under Linux.
Can interface via the Linux kernel i2c modules, or the i8k kernel modules
Includes a simple, yet highly customization display and intuitive
user-interface.
Alarms can be set for each sensor to notify the user once a certain value
has been reached, and can be configured to execute a given command at given
repeated intervals.

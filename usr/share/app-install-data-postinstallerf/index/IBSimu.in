Ion Beam Simulator or IBSimu is an ion optical computer simulation package
for ion optics, plasma extraction and space charge dominated ion beam
transport using Vlasov iteration. The code has several capabilities
for solving electric fields in a defined geometry and tracking
particles in electric and magnetic fields. The code is constructed
as a C++ library for maximal versatility and openness.

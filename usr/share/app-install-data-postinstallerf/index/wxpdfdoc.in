wxPdfDocument allows wxWidgets applications to generate PDF documents.
The code is a port of FPDF - a free PHP class for generating PDF files -
to C++ using the wxWidgets library. Several add-on PHP scripts found on
the FPDF web site are incorporated into wxPdfDocument. Embedding of PNG,
JPEG, GIF and WMF images is supported. In addition to the 14 standard
Adobe fonts it is possible to use other Type1 or TrueType fonts - with
or without embedding them into the generated document. In Unicode build
CJK fonts are supported, too. Graphics primitives allow the creation of
simple drawings.

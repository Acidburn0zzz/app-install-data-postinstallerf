Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer was born as a porting of the
SpreadsheetWriteExcel Perl module to PHP.
It allows writing of Excel spreadsheets without the need for COM objects.
It supports formulas, images (BMP) and all kinds of formatting for text
and cells.
It currently supports the BIFF5 format (Excel 5.0), so functionality
appeared in the latest Excel versions is not yet available.

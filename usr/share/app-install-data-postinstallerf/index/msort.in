Msort is a program for sorting files in sophisticated ways. Records
need not be single lines. Key fields may be selected by position, tag,
or character range. For each key, distinct exclusions, multigraphs,
substitutions. and a sort order may be defined. Comparisons may be
lexicographic, numeric, by string length, date, or time. Optional keys
are supported. Msort uses the Unicode character set and provides full
Unicode case-folding. The basic program has a somewhat complex command
line interface, but may be driven by an optional GUI.

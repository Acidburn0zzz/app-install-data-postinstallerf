Comment3='
python-utmp consists of three modules, providing access to utmp records.
It is quite difficult to access utmp record portably, because every UNIX
has different structure of utmp files. Currently, python-utmp works on
platforms which provide getutent, getutid, getutline, pututline,
setutent, endutent and utmpname functions (such as GNU systems
(Linux and hurd) and System V unices) and on BSD systems using
simple utmp structure.

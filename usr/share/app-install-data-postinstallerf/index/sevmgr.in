sevmgr is a C++ library of discrete event queue management classes and
functions, exclusively targeting simulation purposes.

sevmgr makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for
increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular the
Boost (C++ Standard Extensions http//www.boost.org) library is used.
Install the sevmgr package if you need a library of basic C++ objects
for the discrete event queue management of your simulation project.

The well-known Euler fonts are suitable for typsetting
mathematics in conjunction with a variety of text fonts which
do not provide mathematical character sets of their own. Euler-
VM is a set of virtual mathematics fonts based on Euler and CM.
This approach has several advantages over immediately using the
real Euler fonts Most noticeably, less TeX resources are
consumed, the quality of various math symbols is improved and a
usable \hslash symbol can be provided. The virtual fonts are
accompanied by a LaTeX package which makes them easy to use,
particularly in conjunction with Type1 PostScript text fonts.

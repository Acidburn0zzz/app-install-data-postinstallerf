FileComments guesses the type of a given file, determines the format
used for comments, extracts all comments, and returns them as a
reference to an array of chunks. Alternatively, it strips all comments
from a file.

Currently supported are Perl scripts, C/C++ programs, Java, makefiles,
JavaScript, Python and PHP.

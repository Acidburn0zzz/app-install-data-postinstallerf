Sauerbraten is a networked fast-paced 3D first person first-person shooter
game. It supports rather modern graphic effects and a some nice graphic
details.

The game client also works as the map editor. It is even possible to create
and/or edit a map together with other people over a network connection.
Sauerbraten might be considered unsuitable for children.
This package installs the game client and map editor.

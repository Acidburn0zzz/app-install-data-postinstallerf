Qtractor is an Audio/MIDI multi-track sequencer application written in C++
around the Qt4 toolkit using Qt Designer. The initial target platform will be
Linux, where the Jack Audio Connection Kit (JACK) for audio, and the Advanced
evolve as a fairly-featured Linux Desktop Audio Workstation GUI, specially
dedicated to the personal home-studio.

The ClassMakeMethods framework allows Perl class developers to quickly
define common types of methods. When a module uses ClassMakeMethods or one
of its subclasses, it can select from a variety of supported method types, and
specify a name for each method desired. The methods are dynamically generated
and installed in the calling package.

Construction of the individual methods is handled by subclasses. This
delegation approach allows for a wide variety of method-generation techniques
to be supported, each by a different subclass. Subclasses can also be added to
provide support for new types of methods.

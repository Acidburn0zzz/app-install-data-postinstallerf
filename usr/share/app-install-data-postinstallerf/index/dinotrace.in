Dinotrace is a waveform viewer which understands Verilog Value
Change Dumps, ASCII, and other trace formats. It allows placing
cursors, highlighting signals, searching, printing, and other
capabilities superior to many commercial waveform viewers.

Dinotrace is optimized for rapid debugging. With VTRACE, a simulation
failure will automatically place cursors where errors occur, add
comments visible in the wave form viewer. Four mouse clicks and the
errors will be highlighted in the log files, and the values of signals
at the error will be seen in the source.

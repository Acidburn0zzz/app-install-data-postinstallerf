POD is a pretty simple format to write, but it can be a big pain to deal
with reading it and doing anything useful with it. Most existing POD
parsers care about semantics, like whether a =item occurred after an
=over but before a back, figuring out how to link a L<>, and other things
like that.

PodEventual is much less ambitious and much more stupid. Fortunately, stupid
is often better. (Thats what I keep telling myself, anyway.)
PodEventual reads line-based input and produces events describing each POD

There are several other modules to do this, you probably want one of them. This
module exists as a super-specialized parallel task manager. You create the
object with a process limit and callbacks for what to do while waiting for a
free process slot, as well as a callback for what a process should do just
before exiting.

You must explicitly call $runner->finish() when you are done. If the runner is
destroyed before its children are finished, a warning will be generated and
your child processes will be killed, by force if necessary.

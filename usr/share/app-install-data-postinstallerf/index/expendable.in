This is a program for modelling home finances. In particular, it can
be used to work how long it will take to pay back a mortgage if a
linked "offset" facility is available.  Offset accounts are like
savings accounts, but instead of accruing interest they reduce the
amount of interest charged for the mortgage by offsetting the loan
amount.

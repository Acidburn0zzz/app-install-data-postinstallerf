XU4 is a remake of the computer game Ultima IV. This game requires the
original Ultima IV datafiles, which can be freely downloaded from the internet
but may not be (re)distributed. When you start xu4 for the first time it will
offer to download the datafiles for you.

recreation of the old game, right up to the crappy graphics.  If you
are looking for a game with modern gameplay and graphics, this is not
spirit of the original game will be added.

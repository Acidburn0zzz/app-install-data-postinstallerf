procServ is a wrapper that starts an arbitrary command as a child process in
the background, connecting its standard input and output to a TCP port for
telnet access. It supports logging, child restart (manual or automatic on
exit), and more.

procServ does not have the rich feature set of the screen utility,
but is intended to provide running a command in a system service style,
in a small, robust way.
Handling multiple users, authorization, authentication, central logging
is done best on a higher level, using a package like conserver.

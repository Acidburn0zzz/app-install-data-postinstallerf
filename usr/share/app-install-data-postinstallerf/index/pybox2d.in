Programmers can use Box2D in their games to make objects move in
believable ways and make the world seem more interactive. From the
games point of view a physics engine is just a system for procedural
animation. Rather than paying (or begging) an animator to move your
actors around, you can let Sir Isaac Newton do the directing.

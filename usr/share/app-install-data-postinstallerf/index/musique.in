Musique unclutters your music listening experience with a clean and innovative
interface. Musique automatically fixes misspellings in titles and artist names,
freeing you from the hassle of manually tagging your files.

Features
* Look them in the face. Browse your collection by artists pictures and album
  covers.
* Lyrics. Musique will find and show the song lyrics in the Info View, hiding
  everything but whats related to the currently playing track.

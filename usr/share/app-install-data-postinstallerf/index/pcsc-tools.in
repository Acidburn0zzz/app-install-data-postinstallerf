The pcsc-tools package contains some useful tools for a PC/SC user
pcsc_scan regularly scans connected PC/SC smart card readers and
prints detected events, ATR_analysis analyzes smart card ATRs (Anwser
To Reset), scriptor sends commands to a smart card, and gscriptor does
that from a GTK user interface.

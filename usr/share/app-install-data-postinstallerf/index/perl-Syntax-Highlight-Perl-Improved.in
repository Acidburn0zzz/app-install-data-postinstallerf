This module provides syntax highlighting for Perl code. The design bias is
roughly line-oriented and streamed (i.e. processing a file line-by-line in a
single pass). Provisions may be made in the future for tasks related to "back-
tracking" (i.e. re-doing a single line in the middle of a stream) such as
speeding up state copying.

Comment3='
The GLE Tubing and Extrusion Library consists of a number of "C"
language subroutines for drawing tubing and extrusions. It is a very
fast implementation of these shapes, outperforming all other
implementations, most by orders of magnitude. It uses the
OpenGL programming API to perform the actual drawing of the tubing
and extrusions.

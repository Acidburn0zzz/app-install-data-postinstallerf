The package provides a means of marking a source, so that
samples of it may be included in a document (by means of the
listings package) in a stable fashion, regardless of any change
to the source. The markup in the source text defines tags for
blocks of source. These tags are processed by a shell script to
make a steering file that is used by the package when LaTeX is
being run.y

GDCM implements the dicom base standard part 5 that concentrates on image file
format. Hence GDCM supports the following formats
- ACR-NEMA version 1 and 2 (huffman compression is not supported),
- DICOM version 3.0, including various encodings of JPEG - lossless & lossy-,
RLE, J2K, deflated, JPEG-LS (very experimental) (MPEG2 compression is not
supported)
- Papyrus V2 and V3 file headers should be readable,

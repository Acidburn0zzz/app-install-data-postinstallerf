Comment3='
This plugin embeds an API documentation browser and search functionality
directly into Geanys user interface.  In case you didnt know, Devhelp is an
API documentation browser mainly aimed at GNOME-related libraries, although
there are Devhelp books for a wide range of library APIs.  Check your package
manager and/or Google and you should have no trouble finding books that can
be viewed with Devhelp.

Comment3='
Eclipse Gemini Blueprint project makes it
easy to build Java applications that run
in an OSGi framework.
By using Gemini Blueprint, applications
benefit from using a better separation of
modules, the ability to dynamically add,
remove, and update modules in a running system,
the ability to deploy multiple versions of a
module simultaneously (and have clients
automatically bind to the appropriate one),

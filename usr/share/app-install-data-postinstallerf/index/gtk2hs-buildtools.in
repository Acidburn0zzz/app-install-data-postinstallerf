Comment3='
This package provides a set of helper programs necessary to build
the Gtk2Hs suite of libraries. These tools include

- a modified c2hs binding tool that is used to generate FFI declarations,
- a tool to build a type hierarchy that mirrors the C type hierarchy of
  GObjects found in glib, and
- a generator for signal declarations that are used to call back from C
  to Haskell.
These tools are not needed to compile or run Gtk2Hs programs, only to build

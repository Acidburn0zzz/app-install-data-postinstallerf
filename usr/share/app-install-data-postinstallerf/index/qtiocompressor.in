Comment3='
The class works on top of a QIODevice subclass, compressing data before it is
written and decompressing it when it is read. Since QtIOCompressor works on
streams, it does not have to see the entire data set before compressing or
decompressing it. This can reduce the memory requirements when working on large
data sets.

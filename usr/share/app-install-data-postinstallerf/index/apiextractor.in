Comment3='
The API Extractor library is used by the binding generator to parse headers of
a given library and merge this data with information provided by type system
(XML) files, resulting in a representation of how the API should be exported
to the chosen target language. The generation of source code for the bindings
is performed by specific generators using the API Extractor library.

The Calf project aims at providing a set of high quality open source audio
plugins for musicians. All the included plugins are designed to be used with
multitrack software, as software replacement for instruments and guitar stomp
boxes.
This package contains only LADSPA effect plugins (no GUI), with LRDF.

Comment3='
aubio is a library for audio labelling. Its features include
segmenting a sound file before each of its attacks, performing pitch
detection, tapping the beat and producing midi streams from live
audio. The name aubio comes from audio with a typo several
transcription errors are likely to be found in the results too.

The aim of this project is to provide these automatic labelling
features to other audio softwares. Functions can be used offline in
sound editors and software samplers, or online in audio effects and
virtual instruments.

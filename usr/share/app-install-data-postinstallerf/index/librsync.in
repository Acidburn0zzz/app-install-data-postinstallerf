librsync implements the "rsync" algorithm, which allows remote
differencing of binary files. librsync computes a delta relative to a
files checksum, so the two files need not both be present to generate
a delta.

This library was previously known as libhsync up to version 0.9.0.
The current version of this package does not implement the rsync
network protocol and uses a delta format slightly more efficient than
and incompatible with rsync 2.4.6.

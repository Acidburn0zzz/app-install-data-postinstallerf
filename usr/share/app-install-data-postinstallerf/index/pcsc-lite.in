The purpose of PC/SC Lite is to provide a Windows(R) SCard interface
in a very small form factor for communicating to smartcards and
readers.  PC/SC Lite uses the same winscard API as used under
Windows(R).  This package includes the PC/SC Lite daemon, a resource
manager that coordinates communications with smart card readers and
smart cards that are connected to the system, as well as other command
line tools.

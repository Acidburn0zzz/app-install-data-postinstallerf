Comment3='
Workbench Moderation adds arbitrary moderation states
to Drupal cores unpublished and published node states,
and affects the behavior of node revisions
when nodes are published. Moderation states are tracked
per-revision; rather than moderating nodes,
Workbench Moderation moderates revisions.

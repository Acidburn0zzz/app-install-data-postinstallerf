Comment3='
The h5py package provides both a high- and low-level interface to the
HDF5 library from Python. The low-level interface is intended to be a
complete wrapping of the HDF5 API, while the high-level component
supports access to HDF5 files, data sets and groups using established
Python and NumPy concepts.

A strong emphasis on automatic conversion between Python (Numpy)
data types and data structures and their HDF5 equivalents vastly
simplifies the process of reading and writing data from Python.
This is the Python 3 version of h5py.

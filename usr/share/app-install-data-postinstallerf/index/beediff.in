This package provides a visual application (beediff) for comparing and
merging files. User have a possibility to work with two text
files. Every one is in separate panel. Panels are side by side. All
differences of both textes are highlighted in colors. Operation
buttons (merge, remove) are located direct inside compared textes in
appropriate positions. Program is user friendly, very simply and
efficient.

Keepalived provides simple and robust facilities for load balancing
and high availability to Linux system and Linux based infrastructures.
The load balancing framework relies on well-known and widely used
Linux Virtual Server (IPVS) kernel module providing Layer4 load
balancing. Keepalived implements a set of checkers to dynamically and
adaptively maintain and manage load-balanced server pool according
their health. High availability is achieved by VRRP protocol. VRRP is
a fundamental brick for router failover. In addition, keepalived
implements a set of hooks to the VRRP finite state machine providing
low-level and high-speed protocol interactions. Keepalived frameworks

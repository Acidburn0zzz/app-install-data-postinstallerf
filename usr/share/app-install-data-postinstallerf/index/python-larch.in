This is an implementation of particular kind of B-tree, based on
research by Ohad Rodeh. See "B-trees, Shadowing, and Clones" (copied
here with permission of author) for details on the data
structure. This is the same data structure that btrfs uses. Note that
my implementation is independent from the btrfs one, and might differ
from what the paper describes.

The distinctive feature of this B-tree is that a node is never
modified (sort-of). Instead, all updates are done by
copy-on-write. Among other things, this makes it easy to clone a tree,

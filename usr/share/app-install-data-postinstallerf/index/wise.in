Wise is a Java framework for easily invoking webservices, which can be used as
base for zero-code webservice invocation applications. Wise can be the proper
solution when total and effective client/server decoupling through WS is
required.

While basic JAX-WS tool for wsdl-to-java generation (like wsconsume) are great
for most Java developer usecases, the generated stub classes kind of introduce
a new (or renewed )) level of coupling very similar to Corba IDL; by
generating statical webservice stubs you actually couple client and server.

Comment3='
The php-shout package is an extension to the PHP Hypertext Preprocessor.
It wraps the libshout library available from http//icecast.org/ and
provides native Shout functions to the PHP runtime engine.  Libshout is
a streaming audio library that connects and sends properly formatted
audio data to an Icecast Streaming Media server (also http//icecast.org/).
Libshout "handles the socket connection, the timing of the data, and
prevents bad data from getting to the icecast server."  With php-shout, a
PHP developer can write PHP scripts that act as a streaming media source,
and focus on other robust features, without worrying about the
details of the server communication.

BPG Fonts are a set of GPL licensed Georgian Unicode fonts.

This package contains the Mikhail Stephan font family. This type was first
produced in 1709, by the printing-house of King Vahtang VI. In 1712, it was
used to print "The Knight in the Panthers Skin" by Shota Rustaveli, then
"New Testament" and "The Bible" were printed using updated types prepared
in Tbilisi by Hungarian Master Michael Stefan Hungaro-Valakhian.

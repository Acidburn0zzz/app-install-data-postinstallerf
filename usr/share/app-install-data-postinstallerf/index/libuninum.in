libuninum is a library for converting Unicode strings to
numbers. Internal computation is done using arbitrary precision
arithmetic, so there is no limit on the size of the integer that can
be converted. The value is returned as an ASCII decimal string, a GNU
MP object, or an unsigned long integer.  Auto-detection of the number
system is provided. The number systems supported include Arabic,
Armenian, Balinese, Bengali, Burmese, Chinese, Cyrillic, Devanagari,
Egyptian, Ethiopic, Glagolitic, Greek, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Hebrew,
Kannada, Khmer, Klingon, Lao, Limbu, Malayalam, Mongolian, New Tai
Lue, Nko, Old Italic, Old Persian, Oriya, Osmanya, Perso-Arabic,

CPANTS checks Kwalitee indicators, which is not quality but
automatically-measurable indicators of how good your distribution is.
ModuleCPANTSAnalyse calculates Kwalitee but it is not directly applicable
to your module test. CPAN has already had TestKwalitee for the test module of
Kwalitee. It is, however, impossible to calculate prereq_matches_use indicator,
because dependent module ModuleCPANTSAnalyse itself cannot calculate
prereq_matches_use indicator. It is marked as needs_db, but only limited
information is needed to calculate the indicator. This module calculates
prereq_matches_use by querying needed information from MetaCPAN.

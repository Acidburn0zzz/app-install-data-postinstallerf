syslog-ng, as the name shows, is a syslogd replacement, but with new
functionality for the new generation. The original syslogd allows
messages only to be sorted based on priority/facility pairs; syslog-ng
adds the possibility to filter based on message contents using regular
expressions. The new configuration scheme is intuitive and powerful.
Forwarding logs over TCP and remembering all forwarding hops makes it
ideal for firewalled environments.

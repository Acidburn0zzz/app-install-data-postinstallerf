Grokmirror was written to make mirroring large git repository
collections more efficient. Grokmirror uses the manifest file published
by the master mirror in order to figure out which repositories to
clone, and to track which repositories require updating. The process is
extremely lightweight and efficient both for the master and for the
mirrors.

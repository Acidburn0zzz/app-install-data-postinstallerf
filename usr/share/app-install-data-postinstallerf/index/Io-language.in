Io is a small, prototype-based programming language. The ideas in
Io are mostly inspired by Smalltalk (all values are objects), Self
(prototype-based), NewtonScript (differential inheritance), Act1
(actors and futures for concurrency), LISP (code is a runtime
inspectable/modifiable tree) and Lua (small, embeddable).

suPHP is an apache module for executing PHP scripts with the permissions of
their owners. It consists of an Apache module (mod_suphp) and a setuid root
binary (suphp) that is called by the Apache module to change the uid of the
process executing the PHP interpreter.

Please take a look at /usr/share/doc/mod_suphp-0.6.3/README.fedora for
installation instructions.

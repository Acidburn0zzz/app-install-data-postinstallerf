Comment3='
This binary I/O stream class library presents a platform-independent
way to access binary data streams in C++. The library is hardware
independent in the form that it transparently converts between the
different forms of machine-internal binary data representation.
It further employs no special I/O protocol and can be used on
arbitrary binary data sources.

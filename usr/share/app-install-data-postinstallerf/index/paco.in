After the installation of a source package with "./configure && make && make
install", one is usually left with having no idea of what it was installed and
where it all went, making it difficult to uninstall the package in the future.

Paco was written to solve this problem in a quite simple fashion.
When installing a package from sources, paco wraps the "make install" command
(or whatever command or group of commands are needed to install the files into
the system), and saves installation information into a text database.

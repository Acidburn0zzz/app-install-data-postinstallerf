GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment) is a user-friendly set of
applications and desktop tools to be used in conjunction with a window
manager for the X Window System. The gnome-print package contains
libraries and fonts needed by GNOME applications for printing.

You should install the gnome-print package if you intend to use any of
the GNOME applications that can print. If you would like to develop
GNOME applications that can print you will also need to install the
gnome-print devel package.

This module was inspired by HTMLFormatTextWithLinks which has proven to
be a useful "lynx -dump" work-alike. However one frustration was that no
other HTML converters I came across had the ability to deal effectively
with HTML <TABLE>s. This module can in a rudimentary sense do so. The aim
was to provide facility to take a simple HTML based email template, and to
also convert it to text with the <TABLE> structure intact for inclusion as
"multi-part/alternative" content. Further, it will preserve both the
formatting specified by the <TD> tags "align" attribute, and will also
preserve multi-line text inside of a <TD> element provided it is broken
using <BR/> tags.

These are a few data structures, classes and functions which weve needed
over many years of Python programming and which seem to be of general use
to other Python programmers. Many of the modules that have existed in pyutil
over the years have subsequently been obsoleted by new features added to
the Python language or its standard library, thus showing that were not
alone in wanting tools like these.

Comment3='
This library hopes to provide a more friendly DSL for binding method handles.
Unlike the normal MethodHandle API, handles are bound forward from a source
MethodType and eventually adapted to a final target MethodHandle. Along the
way the transformations are pushed onto a stack and eventually applied in
reverse order, as the standard API demands.

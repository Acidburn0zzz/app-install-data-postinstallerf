UI for quick translation of taxonomies and menus. The i18n module allows for
translation of taxonomy terms and menu items, but the process is tedious - you
need to look up strings you want to translate, there is no overview of whats
already translated etc.

This module presents your taxonomy terms or menu items in a table, and
each language has a corresponding column. Just fill out the translations
and click Save.
Requires the i18n module, and either taxonomy or menu string translation.

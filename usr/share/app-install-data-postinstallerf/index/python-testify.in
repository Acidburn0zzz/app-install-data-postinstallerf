Testify is a replacement for Pythons unittest module and nose. It is
modeled after unittest, and existing unittest classes are fully supported.

However, Testify has features above and beyond unittest, including
 - Class-level setup and tear-down fixture methods, which are run only once
   for an entire class of test methods.
 - A decorator-based approach to fixture methods, enabling features like
   lazily-evaluated attributes and context managers for tests.
 - Enhanced test discovery. Testify can drill down into packages to find
   test cases (similar to nose).

Hyphenation patterns for Serbian in T1/EC, T2A and UTF-8
encodings. For 8-bit engines the patterns are available
separately as serbian in T1/EC encoding for Latin script and
serbianc in T2A encoding for Cyrillic script. Unicode engines
should only use serbian which has patterns in both scripts
combined.

Daemon that listens on netlink socket and processes received quota warnings.
Note, that you have to enable the kernel support for sending quota messages
over netlink (in Filesystems->Quota menu). The daemon supports forwarding
warning messages to the system D-Bus (so that desktop manager can display
a dialog) and writing them to the terminal user has last accessed.

RDFExtras is a collection of packages providing extras based on RDFLib.
The common denominator is "non-core-rdflib".

This project is for collecting several packages with distinct uses, such
as commandline tools, experimental (or unmaintained) stores and similar.
It will be close to RDFLib, but the intent is to keep things here a bit
more loose.
These packages are thus to be considered unstable in general. Useful,
sometimes near core, but not currently guaranteed to never be

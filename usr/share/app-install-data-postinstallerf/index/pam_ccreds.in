Comment3='
The pam_ccreds module provides a mechanism for caching
credentials when authenticating against a network
authentication service, so that authentication can still
proceed when the service is down. Note at present no
mechanism is provided for caching _authorization_
information, i.e. whether you are allowed to login once
authenticated.

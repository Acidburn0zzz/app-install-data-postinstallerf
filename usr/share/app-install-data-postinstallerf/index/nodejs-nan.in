A header file filled with macro and utility goodness
for making add on development for Node.js easier across
versions 0.8, 0.10 and 0.11, and eventually 0.12.

Thanks to the crazy changes in V8 (and some in Node core),
keeping native add-on compiling happily across versions,
particularly 0.10 to 0.11/0.12, is a minor nightmare.
The goal of this project is to store all logic necessary
to develop native Node.js add-on without having to inspect
NODE_MODULE_VERSION and get yourself into a macro-tangle.

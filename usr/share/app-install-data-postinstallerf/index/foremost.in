Foremost recovers files files based on their headers, footers, and internal
data structures. This process is commonly referred to as data carving.
Foremost can work on a raw disk drive or image file generated by dd.  The
headers and footers can be specified by a configuration file or you can use
command line switches to specify built-in file types. These built-in types
look at the data structures of a given file format allowing for a more
reliable and faster recovery.

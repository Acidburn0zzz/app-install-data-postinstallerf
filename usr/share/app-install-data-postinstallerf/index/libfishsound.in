libfishsound provides a simple programming interface for decoding and
encoding audio data using Xiph.Org codecs (FLAC, Speex and Vorbis).

libfishsound by itself is designed to handle raw codec streams from a
lower level layer such as UDP datagrams. When these codecs are used in
files, they are commonly encapsulated in Ogg to produce Ogg FLAC, Speex
and Ogg Vorbis files.

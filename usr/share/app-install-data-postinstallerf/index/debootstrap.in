debootstrap is used to create a Debian base system from scratch, without
requiring the availability of dpkg or apt.  It does this by downloading
.deb files from a mirror site, and carefully unpacking them into a
directory which can eventually be chrooted into.

This might be often useful coupled with virtualization techniques to run
Debian GNU/Linux guest system.

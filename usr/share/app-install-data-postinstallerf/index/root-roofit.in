The RooFit packages provide a toolkit for modeling the expected
distribution of events in a physics analysis. Models can be used to
perform likelihood fits, produce plots, and generate "toy Monte
Carlo" samples for various studies. The RooFit tools are integrated
with the object-oriented and interactive ROOT graphical environment.

RooFit has been developed for the BaBar collaboration, a high energy
physics experiment at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, and is
primarily targeted to the high-energy physicists using the ROOT
analysis environment, but the general nature of the package make it

This plug-in enhances OpenVPN by adding user name and password
authentication in addition. An eurephia user account is a combination of
minimum one OpenVPN SSL certificate and a user name with a password
assigned. It is also possible to setup several eurephia user names to use
a shared OpenVPN certificate.

In addition, eurephia will blacklist IP addresses, certificates and user names
on too many failed attempts and it supports dynamic update of iptables rules
which restricts network access per connection.

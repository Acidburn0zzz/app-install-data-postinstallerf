The goal of Kolor Lines is quite plain. The player has to move the
colored balls around the game board, gathering them into the lines
of the same color by five. Once the line is complete it is removed
from the board, therefore freeing precious space. In the same time
the new balls keep arriving by three after each move, filling up the
game board.

Kolor Lines cannot be won, and is played against the high score
exclusively. The game ends once the whole game board is filled up with
balls

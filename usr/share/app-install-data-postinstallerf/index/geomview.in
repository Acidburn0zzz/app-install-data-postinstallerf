Geomview is an interactive 3D viewing program for Unix. It lets you view and
manipulate 3D objects you use the mouse to rotate, translate, zoom in and out,
etc. It can be used as a standalone viewer for static objects or as a display
engine for other programs which produce dynamically changing geometry. It can
display objects described in a variety of file formats. It comes with a wide
selection of example objects, and you can create your own objects too.

CHiPPS is the COIN-OR High-Performance Parallel Search Framework, a framework
for implementing parallel algorithms based on tree search. The current CHiPPS
architecture consists of three layers. The Abstract Library for Parallel Search
(ALPS) is the base layer of a hierarchy consisting of implementations of
various tree search algorithms for specific problem types. The Branch,
Constrain, and Price Software (BiCePS) is a data management layer built on
top of ALPS for implementing relaxation-based branch and bound algorithms.
The BiCePS Linear Integer Solver (BLIS) is a concretization of the BiCePS
layer for solving mixed-integer linear programs. ALPS, BiCePS, and BLIS
are sub-repostories of the CHiPPS Subversion repository.

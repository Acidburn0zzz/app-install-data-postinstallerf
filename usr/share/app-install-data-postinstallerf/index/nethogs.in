NetHogs is a small "net top" tool.

Instead of breaking the traffic down per protocol or per subnet, like
most such tools do, it groups bandwidth by process and does not rely
on a special kernel module to be loaded.
So if theres suddenly a lot of network traffic, you can fire up
NetHogs and immediately see which PID is causing this, and if its
some kind of spinning process, kill it.

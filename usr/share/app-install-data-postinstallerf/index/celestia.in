Celestia is a real-time space simulation which lets you experience the
universe in three dimensions. Celestia does not confine you to the
surface of the Earth, it allows you to travel throughout the solar
system, to any of over 100,000 stars, or even beyond the galaxy.

Travel in Celestia is seamless; the exponential zoom feature lets
you explore space across a huge range of scales, from galaxy clusters
down to spacecraft only a few meters across. A point-and-goto
interface makes it simple to navigate through the universe to the
object you want to visit.

The Cache modules are designed to assist a developer in persisting data for a
specified period of time.  Often these modules are used in web applications to
store data locally to save repeated and redundant expensive calls to remote
machines or databases.  People have also been known to use CacheCache for
its straightforward interface in sharing data between runs of an application
or invocations of a CGI-style script or simply as an easy to use abstraction
of the filesystem or shared memory.

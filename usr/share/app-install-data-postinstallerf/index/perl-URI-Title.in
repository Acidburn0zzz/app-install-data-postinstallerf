I keep having to find the title of things on the web.  This seems like a really
simple request, just get() the object, parse for a title tag, youre done.
Ha, I wish.  There are several problems with this approach

What if the resource is on a very slow server?  Do we wait forever or what?
What if the resource is a 900 gig file?  You dont want to download that.
What if the page title isnt in a title tag, but is buried in the HTML
somewhere?
What if the resource is an MP3 file, or a word document or something?

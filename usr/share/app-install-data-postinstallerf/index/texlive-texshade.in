TeXshade is alignment shading software completely written in
TeX/LaTeX; it can process multiple sequence alignments in the
.MSF and the .ALN file formats. In addition to common shading
algorithms, it provides special shading modes showing
functional aspects, e.g. charge or hydropathy, and a wide range
of commands for handling shading colours, text styles, labels,
legends; it even allows the user to define completely new
shading modes. TeXshade combines highest flexibility with TeX
excessive development time of the user.

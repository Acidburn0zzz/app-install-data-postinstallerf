GPAC is a multimedia framework based on the MPEG-4 Systems standard developed
from scratch in ANSI C.  The original development goal is to provide a clean,
small and flexible alternative to the MPEG-4 Systems reference software.

GPAC features the integration of recent multimedia standards (SVG/SMIL, VRML,
X3D, SWF, 3GPP(2) tools and more) into a single framework. GPAC also features
MPEG-4 Systems encoders/multiplexers, publishing tools for content distribution
for MP4 and 3GPP(2) files and many tools for scene descriptions
(MPEG4 <-> VRML <-> X3D converters, SWF -> MPEG-4, etc).

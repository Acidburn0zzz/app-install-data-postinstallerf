Comment3='
EQ10Q is an audio plug-in using the LV2 standard implementing a powerful and
flexible parametric equalizer.
The goal is to create an equalizer plug-in that includes parametric equalization
with different filter types like peaking, HPF, LPF, Shelving and Notch with IIR
algorithms and a nice GUI displaying the equalization curve.
At the moment we have implemented second order biquadratic filters (Peaking,
Low Shelving, High Shelving and Notch), and configurable order (1, 2, 3, 4) HPF
and LPF filters. All with IIR algorithms.

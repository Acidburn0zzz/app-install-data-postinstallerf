NumaTOP is an observation tool for runtime memory locality characterization and
analysis of processes and threads running on a NUMA system. It helps the user
characterize the NUMA behavior of processes and threads and identify where the
NUMA-related performance bottlenecks reside.

NumaTOP supports the Intel Xeon processors.

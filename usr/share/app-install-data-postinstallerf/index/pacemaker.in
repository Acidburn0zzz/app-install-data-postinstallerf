Pacemaker is an advanced, scalable High-Availability cluster resource
manager for Corosync, CMAN and/or Linux-HA.

It supports more than 16 node clusters with significant capabilities
for managing resources and dependencies.
It will run scripts at initialization, when machines go up or down,
when related resources fail and can be configured to periodically check
resource health.

A simple connector pool for python-ldap.

The pool keeps LDAP connectors alive and let you reuse them,
drastically reducing the time spent to initiate a ldap connection.
The pool has useful features like
- transparent re-connection on failures or server restarts
- configurable pool size and connectors timeouts
- configurable max lifetime for connectors

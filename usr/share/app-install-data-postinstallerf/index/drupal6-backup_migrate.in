Backup and Migrate simplifies the task of backing up and restoring
your Drupal database or copying your database from one Drupal site to
another. It supports gzip, bzip and zip compression as well as
automatic scheduled backups.

With Backup and Migrate you can dump some or all of your database
tables to a file download or save to a file on the server, and to
restore from an uploaded or previously saved database dump. You can
chose which tables and what data to backup and cache data is excluded
by default.

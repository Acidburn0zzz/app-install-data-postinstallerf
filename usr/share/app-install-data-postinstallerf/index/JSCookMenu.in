  JSCookMenu is a powerful menu script written in JavaScript that can
mimic complex menus found in popular GUI Applications. It is relatively
simple and easy to use. Creating a new theme requires some patience,
but rarely does one has to write one since some good ones are provided.
  The following features are implemented
* Supports both horizontal and vertical menus.
* Supports relative positioning.
* Supports different menus with different themes in the same web page.
* Eases the menu creation process with a menu builder.
* Special effects such as sliding and fading in/out is available.

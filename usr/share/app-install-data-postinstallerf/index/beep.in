Beep allows the user to control the PC speaker with precision,
allowing different sounds to indicate different events. While it
can be run quite happily on the commandline, its intended place
of residence is within shell/perl scripts, notifying the user when
something interesting occurs. Of course, it has no notion of
whats interesting, but its real good at that notifying part.

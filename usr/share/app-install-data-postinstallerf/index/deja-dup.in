D?j? Dup is a simple backup tool. It hides the complexity of doing backups the
right way (encrypted, off-site, and regular) and uses duplicity as the
backend.

Features
 ? Support for local, remote, or cloud backup locations (Amazon S3 or Rackspace)
 ? Securely encrypts and compresses your data
 ? Incrementally backs up, letting you restore from any particular backup
 ? Schedules regular backups
 ? Integrates well into your GNOME desktop

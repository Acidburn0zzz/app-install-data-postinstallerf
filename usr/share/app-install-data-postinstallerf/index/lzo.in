Comment3='
LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
It offers pretty fast compression and very fast decompression.
Decompression requires no memory. In addition there are slower
compression levels achieving a quite competitive compression ratio
while still decompressing at this very high speed.

dircproxy is an IRC proxy server ("bouncer") designed for people
who use IRC from lots of different workstations or clients, but
wish to remain connected and see what they missed while they
were away. You connect to IRC through dircproxy, and it keeps
you connected to the server, even after you detach your client
from it. While youre detached, it logs channel and private
messages as well as important events, and when you reattach
itll let you know what you missed.

Torch is a simple machine-learning library, among its features you can find

* A lot of things in gradient machines, that is, machines which could be
  learned with a gradient descent. This includes multi-layered perceptrons,
  radial bas is functions, mixtures of experts, convolutional networks and
  even time-delay neural networks. In fact a lot of "modules" are available
  that you can plug as you want to get what you need.
* Support vector machines, in classification and regression. As fast as the
  old stand-alone program SVMTorch II, but with the powerful environment of
  the library.

The logutils package provides a set of handlers for the Python standard
librarys logging package.

Some of these handlers are out-of-scope for the standard library, and so
they are packaged here. Others are updated versions which have appeared in
recent Python releases, but are usable with older versions of Python and so
are packaged here.

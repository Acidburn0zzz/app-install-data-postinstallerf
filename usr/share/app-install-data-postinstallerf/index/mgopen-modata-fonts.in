The MgOpen fonts are a font family that includes Latin and Greek glyphs.
The fonts have been released under a liberal license, similar to the
license covering the Bitstream Vera fonts.
This package contains the MgOpen Modata sans serif fixed-stroke-width
which is based on the design of VAG rounded.

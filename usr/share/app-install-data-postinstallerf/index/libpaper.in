The paper library and accompanying files are intended to provide a
simple way for applications to take actions based on a system- or
user-specified paper size. This release is quite minimal, its purpose
being to provide really basic functions (obtaining the system paper name
and getting the height and width of a given kind of paper) that
applications can immediately integrate.

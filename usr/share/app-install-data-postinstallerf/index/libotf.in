Comment3='
The library "libotf" provides the following facilites.
Read Open Type Layout Tables from OTF file. Currently these tables are
supported; head, name, cmap, GDEF, GSUB, and GPOS.  Convert a Unicode
character sequence to a glyph code sequence by using the above tables.
The combination of libotf and the FreeType library (Ver.2) realizes
CTL (complex text layout) by OpenType fonts. This library is currently
used by the m17n library. It seems that the probject Free Type Layout
provides the similar (or better) facility as this library, but
currently they have not yet released their library. So, we have
developed this one.

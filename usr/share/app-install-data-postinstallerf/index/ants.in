You take command in the game of a bunch of small ants and have to guide them
around in levels. Since the ants walk on their own, the player can only
influence them by giving them commands, like build a bridge, dig a hole or
redirect all ants in the other direction. The goal of each level is to
reach the exit, for which multiple combination of commands are necessary.
The game is presented in a 2D side view.

ANGLE is a conformant implementation of the OpenGL ES 2.0 specification that
is hardware?accelerated via Direct3D. ANGLE v1.0.772 was certified compliant
by passing the ES 2.0.3 conformance tests in October 2011. ANGLE also provides
an implementation of the EGL 1.4 specification.

ANGLE is used as the default WebGL backend for both Google Chrome and
Mozilla Firefox on Windows platforms. Chrome uses ANGLE for all graphics
rendering on Windows, including the accelerated Canvas2D implementation
and the Native Client sandbox environment.

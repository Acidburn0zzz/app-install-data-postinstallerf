Orage provides a calendar which integrates nicely into the Xfce Desktop
Environment. It is highly configurable and supports alerts based on dates.
It warns you with popup or audio alarm. As it is an application for every
day use it launches itself in the background as a daemon and can be accessed
using the Orage Clock plugin for the panel.

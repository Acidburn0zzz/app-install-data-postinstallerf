The Linux Director Daemon (ldirectord) was written by Jacob Rief.
<jacob.rief@tiscover.com>

ldirectord is a stand alone daemon for monitoring the services on real
servers. Currently, HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP services are supported.
lditrecord is simple to install and works with the heartbeat code
(http//www.linux-ha.org/).
See ldirectord -h and linux-ha/doc/ldirectord for more information.

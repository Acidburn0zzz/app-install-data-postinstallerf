Comment3='
Shakespeare is a template family for type-safe, efficient templates with simple
variable interpolation. Shakespeare templates can be used inline with a
quasi-quoter or in an external file. Shakespeare interpolates variables
according to the type being inserted. In this case, the variable type needs a
ToCss instance.

This package contains 2 css template languages. The Cassius language uses
whitespace to avoid the need for closing brackets and semi-colons.
Lucius does not care about whitespace and is a strict superset of css.
There are also some significant conveniences added for css.

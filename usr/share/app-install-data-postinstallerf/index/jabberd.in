Comment3='
The jabberd project aims to provide an open-source server implementation of
the Jabber protocols for instant messaging and XML routing. The goal of this
project is to provide a scalable, reliable, efficient and extensible server
that provides a complete set of features and is up to date with the latest
protocol revisions.

jabberd2 is the next generation of the jabberd server. It has been
rewritten from the ground up to be scalable, architecturally sound, and to
support the latest protocol extensions coming out of the JSF.

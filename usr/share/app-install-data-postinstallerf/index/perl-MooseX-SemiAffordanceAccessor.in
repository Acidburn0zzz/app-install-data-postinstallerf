This module does not provide any methods. Simply loading it changes the
default naming policy for the loading class so that accessors are
separated into get and set methods. The get methods have the same name
as the accessor, while set methods are prefixed with "set_".If you
define an attribute with a leading underscore, then the set method will
start with "_set_".If you explicitly set a "reader" or "writer" name
when creating an attribute, then that attributes naming scheme is left
unchanged.

Comment3='
EventRPC supports you in developing Event based networking client/server
applications with transparent object/method access from the client to the
server. Network communication is optionally encrypted using IOSocketSSL.
Several event loop managers are supported due to an extensible API. Currently
Event, Glib, and AnyEvent are implemented. The latter lets you use nearly
every event loop implementation available for Perl.

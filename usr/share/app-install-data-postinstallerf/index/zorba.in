Zorba is a general purpose XQuery processor implementing in C++ the W3C family
of specifications. It is not an XML database. The query processor has been
designed to be embeddable in a variety of environments such as other
programming languages extended with XML processing capabilities, browsers,
database servers, XML message dispatchers, or smart phones. Its architecture
employs a modular design, which allows customizing the Zorba query processor to
the environments needs. In particular the architecture of the query processor
allows a pluggable XML store (e.g. main memory, DOM stores, persistent
disk-based large stores, S3 stores).

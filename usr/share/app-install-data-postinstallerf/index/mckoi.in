Mckoi SQL Database is an Open Source SQL Database System written in Java.
The Mckoi SQL Database project was started in 1998, and the goal was to
build a database management system in a traditional shared disk/shared memory
style architecture. Mckoi SQL Database includes some nice features such as
write-ahead-logging. Many of the design ideas implemented in this project
were carried through into MckoiDDB, the evolution of this project.

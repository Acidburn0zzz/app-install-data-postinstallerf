Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications.

Twisted Mail contains high-level, efficient protocol implementations for both
clients and servers of SMTP, POP3, and IMAP4. Additionally, it contains an "out
of the box" combination SMTP/POP3 virtual-hosting mail server. Also included is
a read/write Maildir implementation and a basic Mail Exchange calculator.

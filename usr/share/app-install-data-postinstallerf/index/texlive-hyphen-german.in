Hyphenation patterns for German in T1/EC and UTF-8 encodings,
for traditional and reformed spelling, including Swiss German.
The package includes the latest patterns from dehyph-exptl
(known to TeX under names german, ngerman and
swissgerman), however 8-bit engines still load old versions
of patterns for german and ngerman for backward-
compatibility reasons. Swiss German patterns are suitable for
Swiss Standard German (Hochdeutsch) not the Alemannic dialects
spoken in Switzerland (Schwyzerduetsch). There are no known
patterns for written Schwyzerduetsch.

Werkzeug
========

Werkzeug started as simple collection of various utilities for WSGI
applications and has become one of the most advanced WSGI utility
modules.  It includes a powerful debugger, full featured request and
response objects, HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control
headers, HTTP dates, cookie handling, file uploads, a powerful URL
routing system and a bunch of community contributed addon modules.

Comment3='
Analyzes the dependencies of a project for undeclared or unused artifacts.

Warning Analysis is not done at source but bytecode level, then some cases are
not detected (constants, annotations with source-only retention, links in
javadoc) which can lead to wrong result if they are the only use of a
dependency.

Word War vi is your basic side-scrolling shoot em up 80s style arcade game.
You pilot your "vi"per craft through core memory, rescuing lost .swp files,
avoiding OS defenses, and wiping out those memory hogging emacs processes.
When all the lost .swp files are rescued, head for the socket which will take
you to the next node in the cluster.

Note Obviously, emacs is a fine editor and this is all very tongue in cheek,
so dont be getting all bent out of shape because you like emacs better than
vi, mmm-kay?

Comment3='
Fakenect consists of a "record" program to save dumps from the kinect sensor
and a library that can be linked to, providing an interface compatible with
freenect.  This allows you to save data and repeat for experiments, debug
problems, share datasets, and experiment with the kinect without having one.

Comment3='
Generate (possibly exuberant) Ctags style tags for Perl sourcecode.

Recursively follows use and require statements, up to a maximum of max_level.
The implemented tagger, PerlTagsNaive is a more-or-less straight ripoff,
slightly updated, of the original pltags code, and is rather naive. It should
be possible to subclass using something like PPI or TextBalanced, though be
aware that this is alpha software and the internals are subject to change.

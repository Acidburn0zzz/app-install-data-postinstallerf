Zenon is an automated theorem prover for first order classical logic
with equality, based on the tableau method.  Zenon can read input files
in TPTP, Coq, Focal, and its own Zenon format.  Zenon can directly
generate Coq proofs (proof scripts or proof terms), which can be
reinserted into Coq specifications.  Zenon can also be extended.

NorduGrid is a collaboration aiming at development, maintenance and
support of the free Grid middleware, known as the Advanced Resource
Connector (ARC).

This package contains the WS monitor system for ARC.
This package is self-contained. It is used to set up a web-based monitor
which pulls information from ISIS and shows it graphically.

Comment3='
The package contains LaTeX support for the DejaVu fonts. They
are derived from the Vera fonts, but contain more characters
and styles. The fonts are included in the original TrueType
format and converted Type 1 format. The (currently) supported
encodings are OT1, T1, IL2, TS1, T2*, X2, QX, and LGR. The
package doesnt (currently) support mathematics. More encodings
and/or features will come later.

Comment3='
The VObject library allows you to easily parse and manipulate iCalendar
and vCard objects using PHP. The goal of the VObject library is to create
a very complete library, with an easy to use API.

This project is a spin-off from SabreDAV, where it has been used for several
years. The VObject library has 100% unittest coverage.

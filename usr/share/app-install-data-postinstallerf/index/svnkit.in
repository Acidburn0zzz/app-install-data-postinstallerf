SVNKit is a pure java Subversion client library. You would like to use SVNKit
when you need to access or modify Subversion repository from your Java
application, as a standalone program and plugin or web application. Being a
pure java program, SVNKit doesnt need any additional configuration or native
binaries to work on any OS that runs java.

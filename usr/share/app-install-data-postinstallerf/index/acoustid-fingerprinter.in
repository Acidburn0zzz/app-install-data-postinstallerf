Acoustid fingerprinter is a cross-platform GUI application that uses
Chromaprint to submit audio fingerprints from your music collection
to the Acoustid database. Only tagged audio files are submitted.
Files tagged by MusicBrainz applications such as Picard are preferred,
but it will submit fingerprints for any files that have tags such as
track title, artist name, album name, etc.

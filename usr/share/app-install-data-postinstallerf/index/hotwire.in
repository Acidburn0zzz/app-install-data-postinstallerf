Hotwire is an object-oriented hypershell.

It is a shell designed for systems programming (files, processes),
and thus it is in the same conceptual category of software as the
Unix shell+terminal and Windows PowerShell.
The goal of the Hotwire project though is to create a better
systems programming shell than both Unix and PowerShell. We call
it a hyper-shell because Hotwire blends the concepts of a
systems-oriented shell with a modern graphical user interface

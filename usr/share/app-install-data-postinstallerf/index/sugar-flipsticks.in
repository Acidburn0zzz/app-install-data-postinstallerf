Flipsticks is a keyframe animation activity that lets you pose and program
a stick figure to walk, run, rotate, twist, tumble and dance. You can save
your animations to the journal and will soon be able to share them via the
mesh. Flipsticks can be used to explore concepts in geometry, computer
programming and animation; it helps develop spatial and analytical thinking
skills.

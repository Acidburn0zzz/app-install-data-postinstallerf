Potrace is a utility for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming a bitmap
into a smooth, scalable image. The input is a bitmap (PBM, PGM, PPM, or BMP
format), and the default output is an encapsulated PostScript file (EPS).
A typical use is to create EPS files from scanned data, such as company or
university logos, handwritten notes, etc. The resulting image is not "jaggy"
like a bitmap, but smooth. It can then be rendered at any resolution.

Potrace can currently produce the following output formats EPS, PostScript,
PDF, SVG (scalable vector graphics), Xfig, Gimppath, and PGM (for easy
antialiasing). Additional backends might be added in the future.

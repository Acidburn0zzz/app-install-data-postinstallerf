The Mana client is developed as part of The Mana Project, which aims to build
a complete 2D MMORPG platform. This includes a client, server and web
component, as well as a library of free content that you can use under the
terms of the GPL.

This version of the client can connect to a specific version of the eAthena
server known as tmwAthena, a version with adaptations made as part of The Mana
World project.

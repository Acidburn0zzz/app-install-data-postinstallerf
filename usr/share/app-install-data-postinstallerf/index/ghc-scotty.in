Comment3='
A Haskell web framework inspired by Rubys Sinatra, using WAI and Warp.

Scotty is the cheap and cheerful way to write RESTful, declarative web
applications.
* A page is as simple as defining the verb, url pattern, and Text content.
* It is template-language agnostic. Anything that returns a Text value will do.
* Conforms to WAI Application interface.
* Uses very fast Warp webserver by default.

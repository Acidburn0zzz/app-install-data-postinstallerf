Comment3='
AppConfig has a powerful but easy to use module for parsing
configuration files.  It also has a simple and efficient module for
parsing command line arguments.  For fully-featured command line
parsing, a module is provided for interfacing AppConfig to Johan
Vromans extensive GetoptLong module.  Johan will continue to
develop the functionality of this package and its features will
automatically become available through AppConfig.

SDL_sound is a library that handles the decoding of several popular sound file
formats, such as .WAV and .OGG.

It is meant to make the programmers sound playback tasks simpler. The
programmer gives SDL_sound a filename, or feeds it data directly from one of
many sources, and then reads the decoded waveform data back at her leisure.
If resource constraints are a concern, SDL_sound can process sound data in
programmer-specified blocks. Alternately, SDL_sound can decode a whole sound
file and hand back a single pointer to the whole waveform. SDL_sound can
also handle sample rate, audio format, and channel conversion on-the-fly

Comment3='
Provides hyphenatable spacing out (letterspacing), underlining,
striking out, etc., using the TeX hyphenation algorithm to find
the proper hyphens automatically. The package also provides a
mechanism that can be used to implement similar tasks, that
have to treat text syllable by syllable. This is shown in two
examples. The package itself does not support UTF-8 input in
ordinary (PDF)LaTeX; some UTF-8 support is offered by package
soulutf8

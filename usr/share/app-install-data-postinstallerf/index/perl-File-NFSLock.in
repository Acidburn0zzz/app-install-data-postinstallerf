Comment3='
Program based of concept of hard linking of files being atomic across NFS.
This concept was mentioned in MailBoxLocker (which was originally
presented in MailFolderMaildir). Some routine flow is taken from
linking a common file to the local file, and then checking the nlink
status. Some ideologies were not complete (uncache mechanism, shared
locking) and some coding was even incorrect (wrong stat index).
FileNFSLock was written to be light, generic, and fast.

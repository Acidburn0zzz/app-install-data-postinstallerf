Defines macros for third-person singular pronouns (\E, \Em,
\Eir, \Eirs), which expand differently according to a
masculine/feminine switch. (If the switch is masculine, they
would expand to he, him, his and his; if feminine,
they would expand to she, her, her and hers". Apart from
the pronouns, one can define word pairs, such as
mother/father, daughter/son, and so on. Gender may be defined
once per document, as an environment, or may be flipped on the
fly.

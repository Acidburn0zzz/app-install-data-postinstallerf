Unicap provides a uniform interface to video capture devices. It allows
applications to use any supported video capture device via a single API.
The unicap library offers a high level of hardware abstraction while
maintaining maximum performance. Zero copy capture of video buffers is
possible for devices supporting it allowing fast video capture with low
CPU usage even on low-speed architectures.

Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL/OGR) is a cross platform
C++ translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats.
As a library, it presents a single abstract data model to the calling
application for all supported formats. It also comes with a variety of
useful commandline utilities for data translation and processing.

It provides the primary data access engine for many applications.
GDAL/OGR is the most widely used geospatial data access library.

Comment3='
This Java package contains a DFA/NFA (finite-state automata) implementation
with Unicode alphabet (UTF-16) and support for the standard regular expression
operations (concatenation, union, Kleene star) and a number of non-standard
ones (intersection, complement, etc.).

In contrast to many other automaton/regexp packages, this package is fast,
compact, and implements real, unrestricted regular operations.  It uses a
symbolic representation based on intervals of Unicode characters.

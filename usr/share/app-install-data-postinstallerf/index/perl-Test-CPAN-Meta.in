Comment3='
This module was written to ensure that a META.yml file, provided with a
standard distribution uploaded to CPAN, meets the specifications that are
slowly being introduced to module uploads, via the use of package makers
and installers such as ExtUtilsMakeMaker, ModuleBuild and
ModuleInstall.

FluidR3 is the third release of Frank Wens pro-quality GM/GS soundfont.
The soundfont has lots of excellent samples, including all the GM instruments
along side with the GS instruments that are recycled and reprogrammed versions
of the GM presets.
This package contains common files shared among all FluidR3 soundfont packages.

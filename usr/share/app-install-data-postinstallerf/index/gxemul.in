GXemul is an experimental instruction-level machine emulator. It can be
used to run binary code for (among others) MIPS-based machines, regardless
of host platform. Several emulation modes are available. For some modes,
processors and surrounding hardware components are emulated well enough to
let unmodified operating systems (e.g. NetBSD) run as if they were running
on a real machine.

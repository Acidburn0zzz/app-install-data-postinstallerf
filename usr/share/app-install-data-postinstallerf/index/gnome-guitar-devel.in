Gnome Guitar is chord and scale database for gnome. It can be used as a stand
alone application (for example you could use it to find how to play a specific
chord or scale) or it can integrate with other applications to provide chord
selection and rendering.

This package contains pkg-config files for developing applications that will
use Gnome Guitar.

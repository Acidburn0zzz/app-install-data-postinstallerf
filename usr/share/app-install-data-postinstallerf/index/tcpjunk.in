TCPJunk is a TCP protocols manipulation and hacking utility that can
be used in different ways. Similar to netcat, TCPJunk can be used as
a client or server, but instead of stdin, it uses a Session file as
the data to send or receive. TCPJunk can be used as a general testing
tool, a traffic generator or a fuzzer, for protocols such as HTTP,
SMTP, POP3, IMAP, FTP and others.

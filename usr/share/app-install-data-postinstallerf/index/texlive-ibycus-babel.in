Comment3='
This package allows you to use the Ibycus 4 font for ancient
Greek with Babel. It uses a Perl script to generate hyphenation
patterns for Ibycus from those for the ordinary Babel encoding,
cbgreek. It sets up "ibycus" as a pseudo-language you can
specify in the normal Babel manner. For proper hyphenation of
Greek quoted in mid-paragraph, you should use it with elatex.
See the README for details.

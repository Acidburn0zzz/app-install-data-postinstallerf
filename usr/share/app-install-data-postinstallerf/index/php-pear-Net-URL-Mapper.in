Net_URL_Mapper provides a simple and flexible way to build nice URLs for your
web applications.

The URL syntax is similar to what can be found in Ruby on Rails or Python
Routes module and as such, this package can be compared to what they call a
router. Still, Net_URL_Mapper does not perform the dispatching like these
frameworks and therefore can be used with your own router.

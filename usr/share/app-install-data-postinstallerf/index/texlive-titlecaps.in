The package is intended for setting rich text into titling
capitals (in which the first character of words are
capitalized). It automatically accounts for diacritical marks
(like umlauts), national symbols (like "ae"), punctuation, and
font changing commands that alter the appearance or size of the
text. It allows a list of predesignated words to be protected
as lower-cased, and also allows for titling exceptions of
various sorts.

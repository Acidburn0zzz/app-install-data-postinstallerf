Comment3='
This plugin is like the (quite old) xfce4-minicmd-plugin, except that it ships
more cool features, such as
* Command history
* Auto-completion (including command history)
* Open URLs and eMail addresses in your favourite applications
* Focus grabbing via D-BUS (so you can bind a shortcut to it)
* Custom input field width

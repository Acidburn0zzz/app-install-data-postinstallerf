libclastfm is an unofficial C-API for the Last.fm web service written with
libcurl. It was written because the official CBS Interactive Last.fm library
requires Nokia QT, which is usually not desired when using GTK+ based distros.

This library supports much more than basic scrobble submission. You can send
shouts, fetch Album covers and much more.
Due to the naming conflict with the official last.fm library, this library will
install as "libclastfm".

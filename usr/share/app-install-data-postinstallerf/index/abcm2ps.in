Abcm2ps is a package which converts music tunes from ABC format to
Postscript. Based on abc2ps version 1.2.5, it was developed mainly to
print Baroque organ scores which have independent voices played on one
or many keyboards and a pedal-board. Abcm2ps introduces many
extensions to the ABC language that make it suitable for classical
music.

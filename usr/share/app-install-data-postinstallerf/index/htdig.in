The ht//Dig system is a complete world wide web indexing and searching
system for a small domain or intranet. This system is not meant to replace
the need for powerful internet-wide search systems like Lycos, Infoseek,
Webcrawler and AltaVista. Instead it is meant to cover the search needs for
a single company, campus, or even a particular sub section of a web site. As
opposed to some WAIS-based or web-server based search engines, ht//Dig can
span several web servers at a site. The type of these different web servers
doesnt matter as long as they understand the HTTP 1.0 protocol.
ht//Dig is also used by KDE to search KDEs HTML documentation.

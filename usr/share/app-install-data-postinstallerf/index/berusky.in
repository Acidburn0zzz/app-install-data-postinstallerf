Berusky is a 2D logic game based on an ancient puzzle named Sokoban.

An old idea of moving boxes in a maze has been expanded with new logic
items such as explosives, stones, special gates and so on.
In addition, up to five bugs can cooperate and be controlled by the player.
This package contains a binary for the game.

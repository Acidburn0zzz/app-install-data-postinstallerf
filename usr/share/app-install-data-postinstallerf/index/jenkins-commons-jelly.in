Jelly is a tool for turning XML into executable code. Its a Java
and XML based scripting and processing engine. A Jelly script
is an XML document which gets parsed into a Script.
The script can then be ran to produce dynamic XML events
which can then be turned into text, XML, HTML etc. Rather like Velocity,
the XML can contain expressions to make the output dynamic
and can work with a variable context.

This package contains slightly modified version of the library
used in Jenkins project.

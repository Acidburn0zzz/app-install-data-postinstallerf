Cproto generates function prototypes and variable declarations from C
source code. Cproto can also convert function definitions between the
old style and the ANSI C style. This conversion will overwrite the
original files, however, so be sure to make a backup copy of your
original files in case something goes wrong. Cproto uses a Yacc
generated parser, so it should not be confused by complex function
definitions as much as other prototype generators.

TestHarness is limited to printing out its results. This makes analysis
of the test results difficult for anything but a human. To make it easier
for programs to work with test results, we provide TestHarnessStraps.
Instead of printing the results, straps provide them as raw data. You can
also configure how the tests are to be run.

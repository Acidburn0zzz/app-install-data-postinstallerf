OCamlP3l is a compiler for Caml parallel programs.

The OCamlP3l programming paradigm is skeleton programming. The
skeletons encapsulate basic parallel programming patterns in a well
understood and structured approach. Based on P3L, the Pisa Parallel
Programming Language, OCamlP3l skeleton algebra is embedded in a
full-fledged functional programming language, namely Objective Caml.
The skeleton programming approach used in OCamlP3l allows three
different operational interpretations of the same source program

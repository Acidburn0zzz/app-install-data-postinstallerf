Comment3='
A secure, effective and simple way of getting mail off a system to your mail
hub. It contains no suid-binaries or other dangerous things - no mail spool
to poke around in, and no daemons running in the background. Mail is simply
forwarded to the configured mailhost. Extremely easy configuration.

WARNING the above is all it does; it does not receive mail, expand aliases
or manage a queue. That belongs on a mail hub with a system administrator.

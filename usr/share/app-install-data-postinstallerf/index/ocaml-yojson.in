Comment3='
Yojson is an optimized parsing and printing library for the JSON
format. It addresses a few shortcomings of json-wheel including 2x
speedup, polymorphic variants and optional syntax for tuples and
variants.

ydump is a pretty-printing command-line program provided with the
yojson package.
The program atdgen can be used to derive OCaml-JSON serializers and
deserializers from type definitions.

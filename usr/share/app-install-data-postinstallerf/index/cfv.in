cfv is a utility to both test and create .sfv, .csv, .crc, .md5(sfv-like),
md5sum, bsd md5, sha1sum, and .torrent files. These files are commonly used to
ensure the correct retrieval or storage of data. It also has test-only support
for PAR and PAR2 files

The bittorent package must be separately installed for .torrent support.

In Greece the terms italic and oblique have the same meaning since they are
borrowed from the latin typographic practice without any real historical
equivalent in Greek history. Until the end of the 19th century Greek typefaces
were cut and cast indepedently, not as members of a typefamily. The
mechanisation of typecutting allowed the transformation of upright Greek
typefaces to oblique designs. Nonetheless, the typesetting practice of a
cursive Greek font to complement an upright one did not survive the 19th
century.

The experimental font GFS Olga (1995) attempts to revive this lost tradition.

Finger is a utility which allows users to see information about system
users (login name, home directory, name, how long theyve been logged
in to the system, etc.).  The finger-server package includes a standard
finger server. The server daemon (fingerd) must be started using
systemctl to receive finger requests.

You should install finger-server if your system is used by multiple users
and youd like finger information to be available.

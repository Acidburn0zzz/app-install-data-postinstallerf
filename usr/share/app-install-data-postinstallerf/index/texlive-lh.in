The LH fonts address the problem of the wide variety of
alphabets that are written with Cyrillic-style characters. The
fonts are the original basis of the set of T2* and X2 encodings
that are now used when LaTeX users need to write in Cyrillic
languages. Macro support in standard LaTeX encodings is offered
through the cyrillic and t2 bundles, and the package itself
offers support for other (more traditional) encodings. The
fonts, in the standard T2* and X2 encodings are available in
Adobe Type 1 format, in the CM-Super family of fonts. The
package also offers its own LaTeX support for OT2 encoded

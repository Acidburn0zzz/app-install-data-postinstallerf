Hesiod is a system which uses existing DNS functionality to provide access
to databases of information that changes infrequently.  It is often used to
distribute information which might otherwise kept in the /etc/passwd,
/etc/group, and /etc/printcap files over a network, eliminating the need to
ensure the files are synchronized among multiple hosts.  This package contains
the header files and libraries required for building programs which use Hesiod.

Ezstream is a command line source client for Icecast media streaming servers.
It began as the successor of the old "shout" utility, and has since gained a
lot of useful features.

In its basic mode of operation, it streams media files or data from standard
input without reencoding and thus requires only very little CPU resources. It
can also use various external decoders and encoders to reencode from one format
to another, and stream the result to an Icecast server. Additional features
include scriptable playlist and metadata handling. All of its features make
ezstream a very flexible source client.

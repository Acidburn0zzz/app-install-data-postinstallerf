This package provides an implementation of the ideas presented in the paper
"Functional Pearl Implicit Configurations" by Oleg Kiselyov and Chung-chieh
Shan. However, the API has been streamlined to improve performance.

The original paper can be obtained from
<http//www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/prepose/prepose.pdf>.
For a summary of the approach taken by this library, along with more motivating
examples, see Austin Seipps tutorial at
<https//www.fpcomplete.com/user/thoughtpolice/using-reflection>.

gjots2 ("gee-jots" or, if you prefer, "gyachts"!) is a way to marshall
and organise your text notes in a convenient, hierachical way. I use
it for all my notes on Unix, my personal bits and pieces, recipes and
even PINs and passwords (encrypted with ccrypt(1)).
You can also use it to "mind-map" your compositions - write down all
your thoughts and then start to organise them into a tree. By
manipulating the tree you can easily reorder your thoughts and
structure them appropriately.

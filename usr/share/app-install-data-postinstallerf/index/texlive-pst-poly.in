This PSTricks package provides a really rather simple command
\PstPolygon that will draw various regular and non-regular
polygons (according to command parameters); various shortcuts
to commonly-used polygons are provided, as well as a command
\pspolygonbox that frames text with a polygon. The package uses
the xkeyval package for argument decoding.

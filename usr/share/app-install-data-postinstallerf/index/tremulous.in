Tremulous is a free, open source game that blends a team based FPS with elements
of an RTS. Players can choose from 2 unique races, aliens and humans.
Players on both teams are able to build working structures in-game like an RTS.
These structures provide many functions, the most important being spawning.
The designated builders must ensure there are spawn structures or other players
 will not be able to rejoin the game after death. Other structures provide
automated base defense (to some degree), healing functions and much more...

Player advancement is different depending on which team you are on.
As a human, players are rewarded with credits for each alien kill.

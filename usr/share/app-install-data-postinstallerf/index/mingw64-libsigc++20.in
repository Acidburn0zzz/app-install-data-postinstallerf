This library implements a full callback system for use in widget
libraries, abstract interfaces, and general programming. Originally
provide for more general use. It is the most complete library of its
kind with the ability to connect an abstract callback to a class
method, function, or function object. It contains adaptor classes for
connection of dissimilar callbacks and has an ease of use unmatched by
other C++ callback libraries.

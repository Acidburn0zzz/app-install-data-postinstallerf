Comment3='
This module provides ways to parse XML documents. It is built on top
of XMLParserExpat, which is a lower level interface to James
Clarks expat library. Each call to one of the parsing methods creates
a new instance of XMLParserExpat which is then used to parse the
document. Expat options may be provided when the XMLParser object is
created. These options are then passed on to the Expat object on each
parse call. They can also be given as extra arguments to the parse
methods, in which case they override options given at XMLParser
creation time.

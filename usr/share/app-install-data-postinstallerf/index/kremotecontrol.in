KRemoteControl (formerly known as KDELirc) is a KDE frontend for your
remote controls. It allows to configure actions for button presses on
remotes. All types of remotes supported by the Solid module in the KDE
platform are also supported by KRemoteControl (e.g. with the Linux
Infrared Remote Control system (LIRC) as backend).

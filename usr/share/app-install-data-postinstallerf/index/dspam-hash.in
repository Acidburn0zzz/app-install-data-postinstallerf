The self-contained Hash-Based driver (inspired by Bill Yerazunis CRM
Sparse Spectra algorithm) is the fastest solution by far and requires no
dependencies, supports an auto-extend feature to grow the file size as
needed, and is very fast and compact. It does, however, lack some
features (such as merged groups support) and uses a lot of memory to
mmap() users. The driver is thread-safe (required for running DSPAM in
server daemon mode).

Comment='<span size="xx-large">(La)TeX support for Arabic and Farsi, compliant with Babel</span>'
Comment3='
The package provides the Arabic and Farsi script support for
TeX without the need of any external pre-processor, and in a
way that is compatible with babel. The bi-directional
capability supposes that the user has a TeX engine that knows
the four primitives \beginR, \endR, \beginL and \endL. That is
accept input in several 8-bit encodings, including UTF-8. Arabi
can make use of a wide variety of Arabic and Farsi fonts; PDF
files generated using Arabi may be searched, and text may be
copied from them and pasted elsewhere.

Comment3='
This module understands the formats used by SQLite for its date,
datetime and time functions. It can be used to parse these formats
in order to create the DateTime manpage objects, and it can take a
DateTime object and produce a timestring accepted by SQLite.*NOTE*
SQLite does not have real date/time types but stores everything as
strings. This module deals with the date/time strings as
understood/returned by SQLites date, time, datetime, julianday
and strftime SQL functions. You will usually want to store your dates
in one of these formats.

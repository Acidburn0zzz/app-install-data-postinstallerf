sratom is a C library for serializing LV2 atoms to/from Turtle. It is
intended to be a full serialization solution for LV2 atoms, allowing
implementations to serialize binary atoms to strings and read them back again.
This is particularly useful for saving plugin state, or implementing plugin
control with network transparency.

This package contains the headers and development libraries for sratom.

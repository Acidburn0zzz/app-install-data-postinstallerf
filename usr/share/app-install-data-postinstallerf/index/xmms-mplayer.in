Xmms-MPlayer is an input plugin for XMMS that allows you to play all audio and
video files in XMMS. Thus, allowing you to use XMMS as a playlist frontend for
MPlayer. This project aims at merely being a connecting link between XMMS and
MPlayer. It does not intend to get involved into any processing of video files,
all that is left to MPlayer.

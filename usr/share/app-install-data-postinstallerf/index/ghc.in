GHC is a state-of-the-art, open source, compiler and interactive environment
for the functional language Haskell. Highlights

- GHC supports the entire Haskell 2010 language plus various extensions.
- GHC has particularly good support for concurrency and parallelism,
  including support for Software Transactional Memory (STM).
- GHC generates fast code, particularly for concurrent programs
  (check the results on the "Computer Language Benchmarks Game").
- GHC works on several platforms including Windows, Mac, Linux,
  most varieties of Unix, and several different processor architectures.

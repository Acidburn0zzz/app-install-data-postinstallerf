suil makes it possible to load a UI of any toolkit in a host using any other
toolkit (assuming the toolkits are both supported by suil). Hosts do not need
to build against or link to foreign toolkit libraries to use UIs written with
that toolkit (suil performs its magic at runtime using dynamically
loaded modules).

Comment3='
x509watch is a simple command line application, written in Perl, that can be
used to list soon expiring or already expired X.509 certificates, such as e.g.
SSL certificates. All certificates are searched by default in the standard PKI
directory, but any other directory can be specified as parameter. Only Base64
encoded DER and PEM X.509 certificates are supported.

MooseXMarkAsMethods allows one to easily mark certain functions as Moose
methods. This will allow other packages such as namespaceautoclean to
operate without blowing away your overloads. After using
MooseXMarkAsMethods your overloads will be recognized by ClassMOP as
being methods, and class extension as well as composition from roles with
overloads will "just work".

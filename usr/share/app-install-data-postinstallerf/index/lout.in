Lout is a document formatting system designed and implemented by Jeffrey
Kingston at the Basser Department of Computer Science, University of
Sydney, Australia. The system reads a high-level description of a document
similar in style to LaTeX and produces a PostScript file which can be
printed on most laser printers and graphic display devices. Plain text
output is also available, PDF output is limited but working (e.g. no
graphics). Lout is inherently multilingual. Adding new languages is easy.

tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP
connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient
for protocol analysis or debugging. A program like tcpdump shows a
summary of packets seen on the wire, but usually doesnt store the
data thats actually being transmitted. In contrast, tcpflow
reconstructs the actual data streams and stores each flow in a
separate file for later analysis.

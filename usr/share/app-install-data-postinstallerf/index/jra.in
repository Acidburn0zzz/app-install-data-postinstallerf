Comment3='
The Java REST annotations are annotations to help service creators build REST
style services. Frameworks which wish to support REST can reuse these
annotations just like the JSR181 & JAX-WS annotations are used across
implementations. However, the idea with JRA is that many different frameworks
(web, XML/SOAP, etc) may want to expose REST style services.

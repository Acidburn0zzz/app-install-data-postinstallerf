The XTEST extension is a minimal set of client and server extensions
required to completely test the X11 server with no user intervention.
This extension is not intended to support general journaling and
playback of user actions.

The RECORD extension supports the recording and reporting of all core
X protocol and arbitrary X extension protocol.

Comment3='
This package provides an imitation of the moderncv class with
the classic style (by Xavier Danaux), to be used in conjunction
with the koma-classes. Thus it is possible to configure
pagelayout, headings etc. the way it is done in koma-classes.
Moreover, it is possible to use biblatex, while the original
moderncv-class is incompatible with biblatex.

Comment3='
This perl module provides support for the https protocol under LWP, so
that a LWPUserAgent can make https GET & HEAD & POST
requests. Please see perldoc LWP for more information on POST
requests.

The CryptSSLeay package contains NetSSL, which is automatically
loaded by LWPProtocolhttps on https requests, and provides the
necessary SSL glue for that module to work.

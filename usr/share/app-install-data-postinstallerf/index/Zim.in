Zim is a WYSIWYG text editor written in PyGTK which aims to bring the
concept of a wiki to your desktop. Every page is saved as a text file with
wiki markup. Pages can contain links to other pages, and are saved
automatically. Creating a new page is as easy as linking to a non-existing
page. Pages are ordered in a hierarchical structure that gives it the look
and feel of an outliner. This tool is intended to keep track of TODO lists
or to serve as a personal scratch book.

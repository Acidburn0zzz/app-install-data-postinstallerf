Pmw is a toolkit for building high-level compound widgets in Python
using the Tkinter module. It consists of a set of base classes and a
library of flexible and extensible megawidgets built on this
foundation. These megawidgets include notebooks, comboboxes, selection
widgets, paned widgets, scrolled widgets and dialog windows.

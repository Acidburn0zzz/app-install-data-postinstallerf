This program emulates an AirPort Express for the purpose of
streaming music from iTunes and compatible iPods. It implements
a server for the Apple RAOP protocol. ShairPort does not support
AirPlay v2 (video and photo streaming). It supports multiple
simultaneous streams, if your audio output chain
(as detected by libao) does so.

GspiceUI is listed among the Fedora Electronic Lab (FEL) packages.

GNU Spice GUI is intended to provide a GUI to freely available
Spice electronic cicuit simulators eg.GnuCAP, Ng-Spice.
It uses gNetList to convert schematic files to net list files
and gWave to display simulation results.
gSchem is used as the schematic generation/viewing tool.

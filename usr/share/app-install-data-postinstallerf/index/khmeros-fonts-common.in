The Khmer OS fonts include Khmer and Latin alphabets, and they have equivalent
sizes for Khmer and English alphabets, so that when texts mix both it is not
necessary to have different point sizes for the text in each language.
They were created by Danh Hong of the Cambodian Open Institute.
This package consists of files used by other khmeros-fonts packages.

The inews program is used by some news programs (for example, inn and
trn) to post Usenet news articles to local news servers.  Inews reads
an article from a file or standard input, adds headers, performs some
consistency checks and then sends the article to the local news server
specified in the inn.conf file.

Install inews if you need a program for posting Usenet articles to
local news servers.

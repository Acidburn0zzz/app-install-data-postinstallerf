Quesa is a high-level open-source 3D graphics library that offers binary and
source level compatibility with Apples QuickDraw? 3D API. Quesa does not
contain any Apple source code, and was developed without access to Apples
QD3D implementation.

Quesa supports both retained and immediate mode rendering, an extensible file
format, plug-in renderers, a wide range of high level geometries, hierarchical
models, and a consistent and object-oriented API.  Quesa acts as a scene-graph
while using OpenGL for rendering.

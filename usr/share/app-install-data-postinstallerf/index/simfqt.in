Comment3='
simfqt aims at providing a clean API and a simple implementation, as
a C++ library, of a Travel-oriented fare engine. It corresponds to
the simulated version of the real-world Fare Quote or pricing system.

simfqt makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for
increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular the
Boost (C++ Standard Extensions http//www.boost.org) library is used.
Install the simfqt package if you need a library of basic C++ objects
for Airline Pricing and Fare Quoting (FQ), mainly for simulation purpose.

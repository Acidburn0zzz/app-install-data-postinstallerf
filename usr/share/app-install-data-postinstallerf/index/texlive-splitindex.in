SplitIndex consists of a LaTeX package, splitidx, and a small
program, splitindex. The package may be used to produce one
index or several indexes. Without splitindex (for example,
using the index package), the number of indexes is limited by
the number of TeXs output streams. But using the program you
may use even more than 16 indexes splitidx outputs only a
single file \jobname.idx and the program splits that file into
several raw index files and calls your favorite index processor
for each of the files.

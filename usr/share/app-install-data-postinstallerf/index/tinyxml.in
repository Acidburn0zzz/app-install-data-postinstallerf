TinyXML is a simple, small, C++ XML parser that can be easily integrating
into other programs. Have you ever found yourself writing a text file parser
every time you needed to save human readable data or serialize objects?
TinyXML solves the text I/O file once and for all.
(Or, as a friend said, ends the Just Another Text File Parser problem.)

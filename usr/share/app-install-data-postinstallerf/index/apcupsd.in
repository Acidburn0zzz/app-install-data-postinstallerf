Apcupsd can be used for controlling most APC UPSes. During a
power failure, apcupsd will inform the users about the power
failure and that a shutdown may occur.  If power is not restored,
a system shutdown will follow when the battery is exausted, a
timeout (seconds) expires, or the battery runtime expires based
on internal APC calculations determined by power consumption
rates.  If the power is restored before one of the above shutdown
conditions is met, apcupsd will inform users about this fact.
Some features depend on what UPS model you have (simple or smart).

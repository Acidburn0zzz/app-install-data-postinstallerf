Flow-tools is library and a collection of programs used to collect,
send, process, and generate reports from NetFlow data. The tools can be
used together on a single server or distributed to multiple servers for
large deployments. The flow-toools library provides an API for development
of custom applications for NetFlow export versions 1,5,6 and the 14 currently
defined version 8 subversions. A Perl and Python interface have been
contributed and are included in the distribution.

This package contains additional documentation, such as man pages in html format.

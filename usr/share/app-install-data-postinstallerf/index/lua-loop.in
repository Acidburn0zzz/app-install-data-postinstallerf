LOOP stands for Lua Object-Oriented Programming and is a set of
packages for supporting different models of object-oriented
programming in the Lua language.

LOOP models are mainly concerned with dynamicity, although there is an
attempt to keep them as simple and efficient as
possible. Additionally, LOOP uses fundamental Lua concepts like tables
(objects) and meta-tables (classes), traditionally used to enable an
object-oriented programming style, to provide a common ground for the
interoperability of objects and classes of its different models.

LibAST is the Library of Assorted Spiffy Things.  It contains various
handy routines and drop-in substitutes for some good-but-non-portable
functions.  It currently has a built-in memory tracking subsystem as
well as some debugging aids and other similar tools.

Its not documented yet, mostly because its not finished.  Hence the
version number that begins with 0.

Comment3='
Zend\Form is intended primarily as a bridge between your domain models and the
View Layer. It composes a thin layer of objects representing form elements, an
InputFilter, and a small number of methods for binding data to and from the
form and attached objects.

The Zend\Form component consists of the following objects
* Elements, which simply consist of a name and attributes.
* Fieldsets, which extend from Elements, but allow composing other fieldsets
  and elements.

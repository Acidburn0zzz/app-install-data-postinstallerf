Valgrind is a tool to help you find memory-management problems in your
programs. When a program is run under Valgrinds supervision, all
reads and writes of memory are checked, and calls to
malloc/new/free/delete are intercepted. As a result, Valgrind can
detect a lot of problems that are otherwise very hard to
find/diagnose.

VM (View Mail) is an Emacs subsystem that allows UNIX mail to be read
and disposed of within Emacs.  Commands exist to do the normal things
expected of a mail user agent, such as generating replies, saving
messages to folders, deleting messages and so on.  There are other
more advanced commands that do tasks like bursting and creating
digests, message forwarding, and organizing message presentation
according to various criteria.

Comment3='
NetDNSResolverProgrammable is a NetDNSResolver descendant class
that allows a virtual DNS to be emulated instead of querying the real DNS.
A set of static DNS records may be supplied, or arbitrary code may be
specified as a means for retrieving DNS records, or even generating them
on the fly.

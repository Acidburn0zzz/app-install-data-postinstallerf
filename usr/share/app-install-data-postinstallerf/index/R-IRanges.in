The IRanges class and its extensions are low-level containers
for storing sets of integer ranges. A typical use of these containers
in biology is for representing a set of chromosome regions.
More specific extensions of the IRanges class will typically
allow the storage of additional information attached to each
chromosome region as well as a hierarchical relationship between
these regions.

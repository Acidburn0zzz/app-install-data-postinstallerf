Comment3='
MicroPHP logging package based on the idea of using closures for
configurability and extensibility. It functions as a static class,
but you can completely control the writing of log messages through
a closure function (aka anonymous functions).

Analog also comes with over a dozen pre-written handlers,
with examples for each in the examples folder. These include
- Amon - Send logs to the Amon server monitoring tool
- Buffer - Buffer messages to send all at once (works with File,
  Mail, Stderr, and Variable handlers)

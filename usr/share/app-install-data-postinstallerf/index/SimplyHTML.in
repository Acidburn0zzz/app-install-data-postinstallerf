SimplyHTML is an application for text processing.
It stores documents as HTML files in combination with
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SimplyHTML is not intended
to be used as an editor for web pages.
The application combines text processing features as known from
popular word processors with a simple and generic way of
storing textual information and styles.

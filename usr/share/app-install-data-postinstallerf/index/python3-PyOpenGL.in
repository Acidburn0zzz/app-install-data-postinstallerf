PyOpenGL is the cross platform Python binding to OpenGL and related APIs. It
includes support for OpenGL v1.1, GLU, GLUT v3.7, GLE 3 and WGL 4. It also
includes support for dozens of extensions (where supported in the underlying
implementation).

PyOpenGL is interoperable with a large number of external GUI libraries
for Python including (Tkinter, wxPython, FxPy, PyGame, and Qt).

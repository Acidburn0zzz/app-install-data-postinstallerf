Deluge is a new BitTorrent client, created using Python and GTK+. It is
intended to bring a native, full-featured client to Linux GTK+ desktop
environments such as GNOME and XFCE. It supports features such as DHT
(Distributed Hash Tables), PEX (?Torrent-compatible Peer Exchange), and UPnP
(Universal Plug-n-Play) that allow one to more easily share BitTorrent data
even from behind a router with virtually zero configuration of port-forwarding.

This package "looks over your shoulder" and keeps track of
files \inputed (the LaTeX way) or \includeed in your
document. You then have permanent access to the name of the
file currently being processed through the macro \finkfile.
FiNK also comes with support for AUC-TeX. As of version 2.2.1,
FiNK has been deprecated and is not maintained anymore. People
interested in FiNKs functionality are invited to use a package
named currfile instead.

Comment3='
Simarrange is a program that simulates collisions between STL meshes in 2D in
order to generate tightly packed sets of parts. It takes a directory of STL
files as input and outputs STL files with combined plates of parts.
The parts are assumed to be in the correct printable orientation already.

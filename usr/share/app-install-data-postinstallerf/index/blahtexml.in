Blahtex is a program written in C++, which converts an equation given in a
syntax close to TeX into MathML. It is designed by David Harvey and is aimed
at supporting equations in MediaWiki.
Blahtexml is a simple extension of blahtex. In addition to the functionality
of blahtex, blahtexml has XML processing in mind and is able to process a
whole XML document into another XML document. Instead of converting only one
formula at a time, blahtexml can convert all the formulas of the given XML
file into MathML.

System Storage Manager provides an easy to use command line interface to manage
your storage using various technologies like lvm, btrfs, encrypted volumes and
more.

In more sophisticated enterprise storage environments, management with Device
Mapper (dm), Logical Volume Manager (LVM), or Multiple Devices (md) is becoming
increasingly more difficult.  With file systems added to the mix, the number of
tools needed to configure and manage storage has grown so large that it is
simply not user friendly.  With so many options for a system administrator to
consider, the opportunity for errors and problems is large.

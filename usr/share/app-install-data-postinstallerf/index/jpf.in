JPF is an  open source, LGPL licensed plug-in infrastructure library for
new or existing Java projects. JPF provides a runtime engine that
dynamically discovers and loads "plug-ins". A plug-in is a structured
component that describes itself to JPF using a "manifest". JPF maintains a
registry of available plug-ins and the functions they provide (via
extension points and extensions).

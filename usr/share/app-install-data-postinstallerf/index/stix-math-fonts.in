The mission of the Scientific and Technical Information Exchange (STIX) font
creation project is the preparation of a comprehensive set of fonts that serve
the scientific and engineering community in the process from manuscript
creation through final publication, both in electronic and print formats.
This package includes one symbol font completing the four faces in the main
stix-fonts package. It replaces the heap of confusing fontlets in the first Stix
release.

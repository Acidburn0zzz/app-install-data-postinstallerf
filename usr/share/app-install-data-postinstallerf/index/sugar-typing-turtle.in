This Sugar activity features a sequence of lessons designed to gradually
introduce students to touch typing, teaching them a few keys at a time
until they have mastered the entire keyboard.

Fun graphics, sounds and characters aim for an entertaining experience.
An on-screen keyboard with overlaid hand positions shows the correct way
to press each key, encouraging good typing habits.

Comment3='
This is the PDL interface to the PLplot graphics library. It is designed
to be simple and light weight with a familiar perlish Object Oriented
interface.

The interface consists of two levels.  A low level interface which maps
closely to the PLplot C interface, and a high level, object-oriented
interface which is easier to use.

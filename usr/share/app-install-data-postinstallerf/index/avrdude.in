AVRDUDE is a program for programming Atmels AVR CPUs. It can program the
Flash and EEPROM, and where supported by the serial programming protocol, it
can program fuse and lock bits. AVRDUDE also supplies a direct instruction
mode allowing one to issue any programming instruction to the AVR chip
regardless of whether AVRDUDE implements that specific feature of a
particular chip.

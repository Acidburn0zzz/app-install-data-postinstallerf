Comment3='
Provides interface for changing scheduler and IRQ tunables, at whole CPU and at
per thread/IRQ level. Allows isolating CPUs for use by a specific application
and moving threads and interrupts to a CPU by just dragging and dropping them.
Operations can be done on CPU sockets, understanding CPU topology.

Can be used as a command line utility without requiring the GUI libraries to be
installed.

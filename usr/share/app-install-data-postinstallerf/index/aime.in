aime is a programming language with a C like syntax, intended for application
extending purposes. The aime collection comprises the language description, an
application embeddable interpreter (libaime), the interpreter C interface
description and a standalone interpreter. Many examples on how the interpreter
can be used (embedded in an application) are also available, together with
some hopefully useful applications, such as expression evaluators.

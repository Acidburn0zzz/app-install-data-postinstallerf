Ronn builds manuals. It converts simple, human readable text files to
roff for terminal display, and also to HTML for the web.

The source format includes all of Markdown but has a more rigid structure and
syntax extensions for features commonly found in man pages (definition lists,
link notation, etc.). The ronn-format(7) manual page defines the format in
detail.

This is a Node.js module for simple dependency graph management in JavaScript.

Say you have a set of resources that depend on each other in some way. These
resources can be anything (eg, files, chains of command etc.).
All that matters is that each one has a unique string identifier, and a list
of direct dependencies.
dep-graph makes it easy to compute "chains" of dependencies, with guaranteed
logical ordering and no duplicates. Thats trivial in most cases, but if A
depends on B and B depends on A, a na?ve dependency graph would get trapped

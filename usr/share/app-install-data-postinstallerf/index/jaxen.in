Jaxen is an open source XPath library written in Java. It is adaptable
to many different object models, including DOM, XOM, dom4j, and JDOM.
Is it also possible to write adapters that treat non-XML trees such as compiled
Java byte code or Java beans as XML, thus enabling you to query these trees
with XPath too.

OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a scene-oriented,
flexible 3D engine written in C++ designed to make it easier and more
intuitive for developers to produce applications utilizing
hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. The class library abstracts all the
details of using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and
OpenGL and provides an interface based on world objects and other
intuitive classes.

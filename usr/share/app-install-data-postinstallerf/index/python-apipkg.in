Comment3='
With apipkg you can control the exported namespace of a python package and
greatly reduce the number of imports for your users. It is a small python
module that works on virtually all Python versions, including CPython2.3 to
Python3.1, Jython and PyPy. It co-operates well with Pythons help() system,
custom importers (PEP302) and common command line completion tools.

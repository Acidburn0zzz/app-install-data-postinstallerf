The Prepopulate module allows fields in most forms to be pre-populated from
the $_REQUEST variable.

For example, the following URL
http//www.example.com/node/add/blog?edit[title]=this is the title
will automatically fill the Title field on a new blog post with the words
"this is the title". Any field can be pre-populated this way, including taxonomy
and CCK fields. You can prepopulate more than one field at a time as well.

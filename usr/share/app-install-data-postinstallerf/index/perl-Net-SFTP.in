NetSFTP is a pure-Perl implementation of the Secure File Transfer
Protocol (SFTP) - file transfer built on top of the SSH2 protocol.
NetSFTP uses NetSSHPerl to build a secure, encrypted tunnel through
which files can be transferred and managed. It provides a subset of the
commands listed in the SSH File Transfer Protocol IETF draft, which can be
found at http//www.openssh.com/txt/draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-00.txt.

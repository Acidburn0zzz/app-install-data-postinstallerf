HTMLTable is used to generate HTML tables for CGI scripts.  By using the
methods provided fairly complex tables can be created, manipulated, then
 printed from Perl scripts.  The module also greatly simplifies creating
tables within tables from Perl.  It is possible to create an entire table
using the methods provided and never use an HTML tag.

HTMLTable also allows for creating dynamically sized tables via its addRow
and addCol methods.  These methods automatically resize the table if passed
more cell values than will fit in the current table grid.

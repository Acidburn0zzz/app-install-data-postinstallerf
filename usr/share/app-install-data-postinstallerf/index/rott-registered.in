This is the icculus.org Linux port of Apogees classic 3d shooter Rise of the
Triad (RotT), which has been released under the GPL by Apogee. This version is
enhanced with the "high" resolution rendering from the winrott port.

This package contains the engine for the registered version of RotT. If you own
the registered version, this allows you to play the registered version under
Linux. Place the registered RotT datafiles in a dir and start rott-registered
from this dir.

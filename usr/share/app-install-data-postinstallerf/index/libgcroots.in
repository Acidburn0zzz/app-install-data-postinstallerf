Comment3='
libgcroots abstracts architecture-dependent part of garbage collector
roots acquisition such as register windows of SPARC and register stack
backing store of IA-64.
This library encourages to have own GC such as for small-footprint,
some application-specific optimizations, just learning or to test
experimental ideas.

JUG is a pure java UUID generator, that can be used either
as a component in a bigger application, or as a standalone
command line tool (a la uuidgen).

JUG generates UUIDs according to the IETF UUID draft
specification (and further clarified in UUID URN name space
IETF draft ) 8211; all 3 official types defined by the
draft 8211 are supported.

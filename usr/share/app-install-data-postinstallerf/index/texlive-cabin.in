Cabin is a humanist sans with four weights and true italics and
small capitals. According to the designer, Pablo Impallari,
Cabin was inspired by Edward Johnstons and Eric Gills
typefaces, with a touch of modernism. Cabin incorporates modern
proportions, optical adjustments, and some elements of the
geometric sans. cabin.sty supports use of the font under LaTeX,
pdfLaTeX, xeLaTeX and luaLaTeX; it uses the mweights, to manage
the users view of all those font weights. An sfdefault option
is provided to enable Cabin as the default text font. The
fontaxes package is required for use with [pdf]LaTeX.

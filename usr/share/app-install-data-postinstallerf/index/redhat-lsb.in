The Linux Standard Base (LSB) is an attempt to develop a set of standards that
will increase compatibility among Linux distributions. It is designed to be
binary-compatible and produce a stable application binary interface (ABI) for
independent software vendors.
The lsb package provides utilities, libraries etc. needed for LSB Compliant
Applications. It also contains requirements that will ensure that all
components required by the LSB are installed on the system.

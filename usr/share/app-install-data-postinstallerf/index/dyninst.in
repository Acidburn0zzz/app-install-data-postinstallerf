Dyninst is an Application Program Interface (API) to permit the insertion of
code into a running program. The API also permits changing or removing
subroutine calls from the application program. Run-time code changes are
useful to support a variety of applications including debugging, performance
monitoring, and to support composing applications out of existing packages.
The goal of this API is to provide a machine independent interface to permit
the creation of tools and applications that use run-time code patching.

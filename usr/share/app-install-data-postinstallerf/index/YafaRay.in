YafaRay is a free open-source raytracing render engine.
Raytracing is a rendering technique for generating
realistic images by tracing the path of light through a 3D scene.
A render engine consists of a "faceless" computer program that interacts
with a host 3D application to provide very specific raytracing capabilities
"on demand". Blender 3D is the host application of YafaRay.

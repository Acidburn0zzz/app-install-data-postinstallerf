Pragma utf8 allows you to write your Perl encoded in UTF-8. That means UTF-8
strings, variable names, and regular expressions. utf8all goes further, and
makes @ARGV encoded in UTF-8, and file handles are opened with UTF-8 encoding
turned on by default (including STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR), and character names
are imported so \N{...} sequences can be used to compile Unicode characters
based on names. If you dont want UTF-8 for a particular file handle, youll
have to set binmode $filehandle.

SpeedyCGI is a way to run perl scripts persistently, which can make
them run much more quickly. After the script is initially run, instead
of exiting, the perl interpreter is kept running. During subsequent
runs, this interpreter is used to handle new executions instead of
starting a new perl interpreter each time. It is a very fast frontend
program, written in C, is executed for each request.

Jam is a program construction tool, like make. Jam recursively builds target
files from source files, using dependency information and updating actions
expressed in the Jambase file, which is written in jams own interpreted
language. The default Jambase is compiled into jam and provides a boilerplate
for common use, relying on a user-provide file "Jamfile" to enumerate actual
targets and sources.

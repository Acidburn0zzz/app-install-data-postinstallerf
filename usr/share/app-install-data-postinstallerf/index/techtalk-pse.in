Tech Talk PSE is is Linux Presentation Software designed by technical people to
give technical software demonstrations to other technical people. It is
designed to be simple to use (for people who know how to use an editor and the
command line) and powerful, so that you can create informative, technically
accurate and entertaining talks and demonstrations.

Tech Talk PSE is good at opening editors at the right place, opening shell
prompts with preloaded history, compiling and running things during the
demonstration, displaying text, photos, figures and video.

The package provides a script that performs on the fly
downloads of missing packages, while a document is being
compiled. (This feature is already available in the MikTeX
distribution for Windows machines.) To use the script, replace
your (LaTeX) compilation command with texliveonfly.py file.tex
synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode", both of which may be
changed). The script is designed to work on Linux
distributions.

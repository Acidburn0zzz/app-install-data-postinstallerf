ionumbers stands for input/output numbers. The package
restyles numbers in maths mode. If a number in the input file
is written, e.g., as $3,231.44$ as commonly used in English
texts, the package is able to restyle it to be output as
$3\,231{,}44$ as commonly used in German texts (and vice
versa). This may be useful, for example, if you have a large
table and want to include it in texts with different output
conventions without the need to change the table. The package
can also automatically group digits left of the decimal
separator (thousands) and right of the decimal separator

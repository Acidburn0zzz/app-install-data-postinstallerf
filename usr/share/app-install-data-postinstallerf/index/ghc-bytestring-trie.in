An efficient finite map from bytestrings to values.

The implementation is based on big-endian patricia trees,
like "Data.IntMap". We first trie on the elements of
"Data.ByteString" and then trie on the big-endian bit
representation of those elements. Patricia trees have
efficient algorithms for union and other merging operations,
but theyre also quick for lookups and insertions.

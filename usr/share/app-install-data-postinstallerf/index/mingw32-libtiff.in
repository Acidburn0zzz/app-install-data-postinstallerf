The libtiff package contains a library of functions for manipulating
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format files.  TIFF is a widely
used file format for bitmapped images.  TIFF files usually end in the
.tif extension and they are often quite large.

The libtiff package should be installed if you need to manipulate TIFF
format image files.

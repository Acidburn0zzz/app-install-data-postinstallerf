Wiggle is a program for applying patches that patch cannot apply due
to conflicting changes in the original.

Wiggle will always apply all changes in the patch to the original.  If
it cannot find a way to cleanly apply a patch, it inserts it in the
original in a manner similar to merge, and reports an unresolvable
conflict.

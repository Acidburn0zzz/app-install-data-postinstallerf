Comment3='
prepaid-manager-applet aims to ease the handling of mobile internet
connections using GSM mobile prepaid cards on the GNOME Desktop.
Such a SIM card can either be in a mobile phone used as a modem,
a USB 3g module (USB surf stick) or used by the built in 3G
chip set in your laptop/net book.

* It allows you to check the current balance and to top up the credit.
* It uses ModemManager to talk to your GSM chip set.

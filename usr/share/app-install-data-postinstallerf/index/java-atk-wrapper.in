Java ATK Wrapper is a implementation of ATK by using JNI technic. It
converts Java Swing events into ATK events, and send these events to
ATK-Bridge.

JAW is part of the Bonobo deprecation project. It will replaces the
former java-access-bridge.
By talking to ATK-Bridge, it keeps itself from being affected by the
change of underlying communication mechanism.

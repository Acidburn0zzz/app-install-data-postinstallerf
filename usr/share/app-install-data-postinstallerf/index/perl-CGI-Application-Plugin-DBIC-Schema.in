Comment3='
CGIApplicationPluginDBICSchema adds easy access to a
DBIxClassSchema to your Titanium or CGIApplication modules. Lazy
loading is used to prevent a database connection from being made if the
schema method is not called during the request. In other words, the
database connection is not created until it is actually needed.

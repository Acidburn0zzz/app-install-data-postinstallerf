Libnet is an API to help with the construction and handling of network
packets. It provides a portable framework for low-level network packet
writing and handling (use libnet in conjunction with libpcap and you can
write some really cool stuff). Libnet includes packet creation at the IP
layer and at the link layer as well as a host of supplementary and
complementary functionality.

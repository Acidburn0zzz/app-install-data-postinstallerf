It is often a pain to write a server program that supports graceful
restarts, with no resource leaks. ServerStarter, solves the problem by
splitting the task into two. One is start_server, a script provided as a
part of the module, which works as a superdaemon that binds to zero or
more TCP ports, and repeatedly spawns the server program that actually
handles the necessary tasks (for example, responding to incoming
connections). The spawned server programs under ServerStarter call
accept(2) and handle the requests.

Mx is a clutter widget toolkit that provides a set of standard user interface
elements, including buttons, progress bars, tooltips, scroll bars and others.
It also implements some standard layout managers. One other interesting feature
is the possibility of setting style properties from a css-like file. It is
currently used by Moblin to provide the user experience.

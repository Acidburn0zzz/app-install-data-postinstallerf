This module implements ISO 8601 date, time and duration parsing. The
implementation follows ISO86012004 standard, and implements only date/time
representations mentioned in the standard. If something is not mentioned there,
then it is treated as non existent, and not as an allowed option.

For instance, ISO86012004 never mentions 2 digit years. So, it is not intended
by this module to support 2 digit years. (while it may still be valid as ISO
date, because it is not explicitly forbidden.) Another example is, when no time
zone information is given for a time, then it should be interpreted as local
time, and not UTC.

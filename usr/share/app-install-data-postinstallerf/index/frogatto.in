An old-school 2D platform game, starring a certain quixotic frog. Frogatto
has gorgeous, high-end pixel art, pumping arcade tunes, and all the gameplay
nuance of a classic console title. Run and jump over pits and enemies. Grab
enemies with your tongue, swallow them, and then spit them out at other enemies
as projectiles! Fight dangerous bosses, and solve vexing puzzles. Collect coins
and use them to buy upgrades and new abilities in the store. Talk to characters
in game, and work to unravel Big Bad Milgrams plot against the townsfolk!

jack-keyboard is a virtual MIDI keyboard - a program that allows you to send
JACK MIDI events using your PC keyboard. Its somewhat similar to vkeybd,
except it uses JACK MIDI instead of ALSA, and the default keyboard mapping is
much better - it uses the same layout as trackers (like Impulse Tracker) did,
so you have two and half octaves under your fingers.

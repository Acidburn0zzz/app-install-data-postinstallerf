GNU Ocrad is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) program based on a feature
extraction method. It reads images in pbm (bitmap), pgm (greyscale) or ppm
(color) formats and produces text in byte (8-bit) or UTF-8 formats.
Also includes a layout analyser able to separate the columns or blocks of text
normally found on printed pages.
Ocrad can be used as a stand-alone console application, or as a backend to
other programs.

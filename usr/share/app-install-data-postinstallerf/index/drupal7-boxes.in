Boxes module is a re-implementation of the custom blocks (boxes) that the core
block module provides. It is a proof of concept for what a re-worked block
module could do.

The module assumes that custom blocks are configuration, and not content. This
means that it is a reasonable action to ask for all blocks at one time, this is
in fact exactly what the core block module does.
Boxes provides an inline interface for editing blocks, allowing you to change
the contents of blocks without going to an admin page.

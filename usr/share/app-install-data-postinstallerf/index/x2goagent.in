X2go agent functionality has been completely incorporated into
nxagents code base. If the nxagent binary is executed under the name
of "x2goagent", the X2go functionalities get activated.

The x2goagent package is a wrapper that activates X2Go branding in
nxagent. Please refer to the nxagent packages description for more
information on NX.

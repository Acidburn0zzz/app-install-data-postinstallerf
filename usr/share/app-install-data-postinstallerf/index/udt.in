UDT is a reliable UDP based application level data transport protocol
for distributed data intensive applications over wide area high-speed
networks. UDT uses UDP to transfer bulk data with its own reliability
control and congestion control mechanisms. The new protocol can
transfer data at a much higher speed than TCP does. UDT is also a
highly configurable framework that can accommodate various congestion
control algorithms.

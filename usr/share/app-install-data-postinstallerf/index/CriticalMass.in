Critical Mass (aka Critter) is an SDL/OpenGL space shootem up game. Your
world has been infested by an aggressive army of space critters. Overrun and
unprepared, your government was unable to defend its precious resources. As
a last effort to recapture some of the "goodies", you have been placed into
a tiny spacecraft and sent after them.

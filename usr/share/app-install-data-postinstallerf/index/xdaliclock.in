XDaliClock is a large digital clock for the X Window System, with digits
that "melt" into their new shapes when the time changes. XDaliClock
supports 12 and 24 hour modes, and displays the date when you hold a mouse
button down over it. It also can be configured to do colormap cycling, and
for window transparency.

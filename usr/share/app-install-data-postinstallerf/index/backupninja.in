Backupninja allows you to coordinate system backup by dropping a few simple
configuration files into /etc/backup.d/. Most programs you might use for making
backups dont have their own configuration file format. Backupninja provides
a centralized way to configure and schedule many different backup utilities.

It allows for secure, remote, incremental file system backup (via rdiff-backup),
compressed incremental data, backup system and hardware info, encrypted remote
backups (via duplicity), safe backup of MySQL/PostgreSQL databases, subversion
or trac repositories, burn CD/DVDs or create ISOs, incremental rsync with
hard-linking.

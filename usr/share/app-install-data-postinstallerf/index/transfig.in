The transfig utility creates a makefile which translates FIG (created
by xfig) or PIC figures into a specified LaTeX graphics language (for
example, PostScript(TM)).  Transfig is used to create TeX documents
which are portable (i.e., they can be printed in a wide variety of
environments).

Install transfig if you need a utility for translating FIG or PIC
figures into certain graphics languages.

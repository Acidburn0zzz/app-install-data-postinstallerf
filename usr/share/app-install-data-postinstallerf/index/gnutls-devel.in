GnuTLS is a secure communications library implementing the SSL, TLS and DTLS
protocols and technologies around them. It provides a simple C language
application programming interface (API) to access the secure communications
protocols as well as APIs to parse and write X.509, PKCS #12, OpenPGP and
other required structures.
This package contains files needed for developing applications with
the GnuTLS library.

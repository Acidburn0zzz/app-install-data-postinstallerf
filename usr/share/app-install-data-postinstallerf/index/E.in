E is a purely equational theorem prover for full first-order logic.
That means it is a program that you can stuff a mathematical
specification (in first-order format) and a hypothesis into, and which
will then run forever, using up all of your machines resources.  Very
occasionally it will find a proof for the hypothesis and tell you so.

Es inference core is based on a modified version of the superposition
calculus for equational clausal logic.  Both clausification and
reasoning on the clausal form can be documented in checkable proof
objects.

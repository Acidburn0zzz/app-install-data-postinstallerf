Amazons is a game played on a 10x10 chess board. Each side has four
pieces (amazons) that move like chess queens (in a straight line in
any direction). Instead of capturing pieces like in chess, the game is
determined based on who moves last.

Each move consists of two parts. First an amazon moves to a new square
and then fires an arrow to another square (the arrow is fired in a
straight line in any direction from the square the amazon landed
on). The square the arrow lands on becomes a permenant block for the
rest of the game. No one can move over it, or fire an arrow over

Comment3='

Gentium Basic and Gentium Book Basic are font families based on the
original Gentium design, but with additional weights. Both families come
with a complete regular, bold, italic and bold italic set of fonts.
These "Basic" fonts support only the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
Unicode ranges, plus a selection of the more commonly used extended Latin
characters, with miscellaneous diacritical marks, symbols and punctuation.
The "Book" family is slightly heavier.

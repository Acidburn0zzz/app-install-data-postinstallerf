Comment3='
libQGLViewer is a C++ library based on Qt that eases the creation of OpenGL
3D viewers. It provides some of the typical 3D viewer functionality, such
as the possibility to move the camera using the mouse, which lacks in most
of the other APIs. Other features include mouse manipulated frames,
interpolated keyFrames, object selection, stereo display, screenshot saving
and much more. It can be used by OpenGL beginners as well as to create
complex applications, being fully customizable and easy to extend.

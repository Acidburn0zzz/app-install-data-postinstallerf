Batti is a simple battery monitor for the system tray, similar to batterymon.
Unlike the latter batti uses UPower, and if that is missing DeviceKit.Power,
for its power information.

Features
* one tray icon per inserted battery
* tray icons (dis-)appear with the battery (un-)plugging
* notification on low and critical battery status
* use of GTK icon-theme
* suspend/hibernate menu on left-click, if allowed by PolicyKit

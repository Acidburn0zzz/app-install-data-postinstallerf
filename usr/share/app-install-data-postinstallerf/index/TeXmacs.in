GNU TeXmacs is a free scientific text editor, which was both inspired
by TeX and GNU Emacs. The editor allows you to write structured
documents via a WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) and user
friendly interface.  New styles may be created by the user. The
program implements high-quality typesetting algorithms and TeX fonts,
which help you to produce professionally looking documents.

The high typesetting quality still goes through for automatically
generated formulas, which makes TeXmacs suitable as an interface for
computer algebra systems. TeXmacs also supports the Guile/Scheme

Comment3='
Synergy+ (synergy-plus) lets you easily share a single mouse and keyboard
between multiple computers with different operating systems, without special
hardware. All you need is a LAN connection. Its intended for users with
multiple computers, where each system uses its own display. Its a little
like having a 2nd or a 3rd desktop.
Synergy+ is a maintenance fork for implementing bug fixes to the original
Synergy, which hasnt received any source updates or new releases since 2006.

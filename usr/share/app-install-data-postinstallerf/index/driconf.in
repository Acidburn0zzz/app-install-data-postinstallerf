DRIconf is a configuration applet for the Direct Rendering Infrastructure.
It allows customizing performance and visual quality settings of OpenGL
drivers on a per-driver, per-screen and/or per-application level.

The settings are stored in system wide and per-user XML configuration files,
which are parsed by the OpenGL drivers on startup.
DRIConf is written in Python with the python-gtk toolkit bindings.

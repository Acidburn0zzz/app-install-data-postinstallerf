The Globus Toolkit is an open source software toolkit used for building Grid
systems and applications. It is being developed by the Globus Alliance and
many others all over the world. A growing number of projects and companies are
using the Globus Toolkit to unlock the potential of grids for their cause.

The globus-gfork-progs package contains
GFork Programs - GFork is user configurable super-server daemon very similar
to xinetd. It listens on a TCP port. When clients connect to a port it runs an
administrator defined program which services that client connection, just as
x/inetd do.

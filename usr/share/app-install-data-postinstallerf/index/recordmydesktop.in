recordMyDesktop is a desktop session recorder for linux that attempts to be
easy to use, yet also effective at its primary task.

As such, the program is separated in two parts; a simple command line tool that
performs the basic tasks of capturing and encoding and an interface that
exposes the program functionality in a usable way.

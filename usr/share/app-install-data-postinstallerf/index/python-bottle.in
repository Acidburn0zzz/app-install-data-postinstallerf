Bottle is a fast and simple micro-framework for small web-applications.
It offers request dispatching (Routes) with URL parameter support, Templates,
a built-in HTTP Server and adapters for many third party WSGI/HTTP-server and
template engines. All in a single file and with no dependencies other than the
Python Standard Library.

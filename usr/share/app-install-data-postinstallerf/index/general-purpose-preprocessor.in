GPP is a general-purpose preprocessor with customizable syntax,
suitable for a wide range of preprocessing tasks. Its independence
from any one programming language makes it much more versatile than
the C preprocessor (cpp), while its syntax is lighter and more
flexible than that of GNU m4. There are built-in macros for use with
C/C++, LaTeX, HTML, XHTML, and Prolog files.

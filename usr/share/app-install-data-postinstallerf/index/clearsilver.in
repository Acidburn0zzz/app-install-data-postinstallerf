ClearSilver is a fast, powerful, and language-neutral HTML template
system.  In both static content sites and dynamic HTML applications,
it provides a separation between presentation code and application
logic which makes working with your project easier.  The design of
ClearSilver began in 1999, and evolved during its use at onelist.com,
egroups.com, and Yahoo! Groups.  Today many other projects and
websites are using it.

Rekall is a database front-end, however, Rekall is not itself a
database, and does not include a database. By this we mean that data
is stored somewhere else in an SQL server, and Rekall is fundementally
just a tool to extract, display and update that data (of course, it does
lots more than that, it does forms and reports and scripting...). It is
database agnostic, and does not have any preferred database (plugins are
available for MySQL and PostgreSQL).

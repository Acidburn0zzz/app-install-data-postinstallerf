The Local Centre MAPping Service (LCMAPS) is a security middleware
component that processes the users Grid credentials (typically X.509
proxy certificates and VOMS attributes) and maps the user to a local
account based on the site local policy.

It is a highly configurable pluggable interface, and many plugins are
available to tailor almost every need. Since this is middleware, it
does not interact with the user directly; to use it in a program please
see the lcmaps-interface package.

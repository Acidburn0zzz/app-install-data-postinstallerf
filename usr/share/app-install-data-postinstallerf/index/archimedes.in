Archimedes is a package for the design and simulation of submicron
semiconductor devices. It is a 2D Fast Monte Carlo simulator which can take
into account all the relevant quantum effects, thank to the implementation of
the Bohm effective potential method.

The physics and geometry of a general device is introduced by typing a simple
script, which makes, in this sense, Archimedes a powerful tool for the
simulation of quite general semiconductor devices.

Snowball is a small string processing language
designed for creating stemming algorithms
for use in Information Retrieval.

This package contains all you need to include the
snowball stemming algorithms into a Java
project of your own. If you use this,
you dont need to use the snowball compiler,
or worry about the internals of the
stemmers in any way.

The zarafa-search package includes the Zarafa Indexing service for fast
and full-text searching. Using CLucene search engine, this service makes
an index per user of messages and attachments for the Zarafa server. At
search queries, the server will use this index to quickly find messages,
items and even in contents of attached documents.

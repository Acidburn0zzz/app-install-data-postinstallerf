statsmodels is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the
estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting
statistical tests, and statistical data exploration. An extensive list of
result statistics are available for each estimator. The results are tested
against existing statistical packages to ensure that they are correct.

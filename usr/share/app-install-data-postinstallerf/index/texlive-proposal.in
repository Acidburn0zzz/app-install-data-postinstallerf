The process of preparing a collaborative proposal, to a major
funding body, involves integration of contributions of a many
people at many sites. It is therefore an ideal application for
a text-based document preparation system such as LaTeX, in
concert with a distributed version control system such as SVN.
The proposal class itself provides a basis for such an
enterprise. The dfgproposal and dfgproposal classes provide two
specialisations of the base class for (respectively) German and
European research proposals. The packages depend on the
authors stex bundle.

WebSVN offers a view onto your subversion repositories thats been designed to
reflect the Subversion methodology. You can view the log of any file or
directory and see a list of all the files changed, added or deleted in any
given revision. You can also view the differences between two versions of a
file so as to see exactly what was changed in a particular revision.

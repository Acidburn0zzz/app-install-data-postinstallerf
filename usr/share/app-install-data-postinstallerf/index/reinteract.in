Reinteract is a system for interactive experimentation with Python.
Reinteract worksheets contain Python code combined with the results of
that code, formatted as text or graphical plots. Unlike a traditional
shell, you can go back and edit previously entered statements, and the
results will update. Among other things, Reinteract is suitable for
experimentation with the Python language and for data analysis
using the Numpy and SciPy libraries.

Comment3='
foo2qpdl is an open source printer driver for printers that use the
QPDL wire protocol for their print data, such as the Samsung CLP-300
or the Samsung CLP-600 or the Xerox Phaser 6110. These printers are
often erroneously referred to as winprinters or GDI printers. However,
Microsoft GDI only mandates the API between an application and the
printer driver, not the protocol on the wire between the printer
driver and the printer. In fact, QPDL printers are raster printers
which happen to use a very efficient wire protocol. QPDL is just one
of many wire protocols that are in use today, such as Postscript, PCL,
Epson, ZjStream, etc.

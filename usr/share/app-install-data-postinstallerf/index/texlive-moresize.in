Comment3='
A package for using font sizes up to 35.88pt, for example with
the EC fonts. New commands \HUGE and \ssmall for selecting font
sizes are provided together with some options working around
current LaTeX2e shortcomings in using big font sizes. The
package also provides options for improving the typesetting of
paragraphs (or headlines) with embedded math expressions at
font sizes above 17.28pt.

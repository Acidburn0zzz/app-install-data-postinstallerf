A package providing font definition files (plus a replacement
for the package exscale) to access many of the fonts in
Sauters collection. These fonts are available in all point
sizes and look nicer for such "intermediate" document sizes as
11pt. Also included is the package sbbm, an alternative to
access the bbm fonts, a nice collection of blackboard bold
symbols.

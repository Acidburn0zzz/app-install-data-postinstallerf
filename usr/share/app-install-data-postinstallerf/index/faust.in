Faust AUdio STreams is a functional programming language for real-time audio
signal processing. Its programming model combines two approaches  functional
programming and block diagram composition. You can think of FAUST as a
structured block diagram language with a textual syntax.

FAUST is intended for developers who need to develop efficient C/C++ audio
plugins for existing systems or full standalone audio applications. Thanks to
some specific compilation techniques and powerful optimizations, the C++ code
generated by the Faust compiler is usually very fast. It can generally compete
with (and sometimes outperform) hand-written C code.

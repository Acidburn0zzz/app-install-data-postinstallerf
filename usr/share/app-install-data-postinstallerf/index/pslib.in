pslib is a C-library to create PostScript files on the fly. It offers many
drawing primitives, inclusion of png and eps images and a very sophisticated
text rendering including hyphenation, kerning and ligatures. It can read
external Type1 fonts and embed them into the output file. It supports pdfmarks
which makes it in combination with ghostscripts pdfwriter an alternative for
libraries creating PDF.

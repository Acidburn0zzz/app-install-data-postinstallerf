The Gold Allocation Manager is an open source accounting system developed by
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) as part of the Department of
Energy (DOE) Scalable Systems Software Project (SSS). It tracks resource usage
on High Performance Computers and acts much like a bank, establishing accounts
in order to pre-allocate user and project resource usage over specific nodes and
time-frame. Gold provides balance and usage feedback to users, managers, and
system administrators.  SQLite is used by default, but Gold can be configured
to use either MySQL or PostgreSQL instead.

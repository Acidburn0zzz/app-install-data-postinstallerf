Many dynamic websites perform heavy processing on most pages, yet this
information may rarely change from request to request. Using the PageCache
plugin, you can cache the full output of different pages so they are served
to your visitors as fast as possible. This method of caching is very useful
for withstanding a Slashdotting, for example.

Comment3='
The JOGL project hosts the development version of the Java Binding for
the OpenGL API (JSR-231), and is designed to provide hardware-supported 3D
graphics to applications written in Java. JOGL provides full access to the
APIs in the OpenGL 2.0 specification as well as nearly all vendor extensions,
and integrates with the AWT and Swing widget sets. It is part of a suite of
Sun Microsystems.

Comment3='
A simple Django extension that provides support for Rails-like flash messages.

The flash is a temporary storage mechanism that looks like a Python
dictionary, so you can store values associated with keys and later retrieve
them. It has one special property by default, values stored into the flash
during the processing of a request will be available during the processing
of the immediately following request. Once that second request has been
processed, those values are removed automatically from the storage.

Comment3='
XMLDumper dumps Perl data to XML format. XMLDumper can also read
XML data that were previously dumped by the module and convert it back
to Perl. Perl objects are blessed back to their original packaging;
if the modules are installed on the system where the perl objects are
reconstituted from xml, they will behave as expected. Intuitively, if
the perl objects are converted and reconstituted in the same
environment, all should be well.

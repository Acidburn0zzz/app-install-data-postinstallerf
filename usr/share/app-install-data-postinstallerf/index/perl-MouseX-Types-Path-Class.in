MouseXTypesPathClass creates common Mouse types, coercions and option
specifications useful for dealing with PathClass objects as Mouse attributes.

Coercions (see MouseUtilTypeConstraints) are made from both Str and
ArrayRef to both PathClassDir and PathClassFile objects. If you have
MouseXGetopt installed, the Getopt option type ("=s") will be added for both
PathClassDir and PathClassFile.

Comment3='
A set of tools and methods for making and manipulating transcript centric
annotations. With these tools the user can easily download the genomic
locations of the transcripts, exons and cds of a given organism, from either
the UCSC Genome Browser or a BioMart database (more sources will be supported
in the future). This information is then stored in a local database that
keeps track of the relationship between transcripts, exons, cds and genes.
Flexible methods are provided for extracting the desired features in a
convenient format.

The cellmodem plugin is a monitoring plugin for cellular modems. It reports
provider and signal quality for GPRS/UMTS(3G)/HSDPA(3.5G) modem cards. It
works with (mostly) all cards which support an out-of-band channel for
monitoring purposes. Current features include
* Display the current network type (GPRS/UMTS)
* Display the current signal level
* Configure the maximum signal level
* Configure the low and critical signal level
* Asking for PIN if modem needs it
* Quick visual feedback on modem and registration status via LEDs

Pogos elementary-inspired design uses the screen-space very efficiently. It is
especially well-suited for people who organize their music by albums on the
harddrive. The main interface components are a directory tree and a playlist
that groups albums in an innovative way.
Pogo is a fork of Decibel Audio Player.

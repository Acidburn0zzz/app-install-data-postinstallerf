Comment3='
The package provides commands for typesetting a CV or resume.
It provides commands for general-purpose headings, entries, and
item/description pairs, as well as more specific commands for
formatting sections, with explicit inclusion of school, degree,
employer, job, conference, and publications entries. It tends
to produce a somewhat long and quite detailed document but may
also be suitable to support a shorter resume.

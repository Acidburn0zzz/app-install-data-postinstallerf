BPG Fonts are a set of GPL licensed Georgian Unicode fonts.

This package contains the Irubaqidze font family. In 1628 Georgian printing
types were produced for the first time, in Rome. The "Georgian-Italian
Dictionary"  and "Georgian Prayers" were printed in Rome, 1629, by Stephano
Paolini and Nikiphore Irbach (Irubakhidze-Cholokashvili). In 1643, in Rome,
"Georgian Grammar" by Francisco-Maria Majio was printed, using Nuskhuri,
Asomtavruli and Mkhedruli. Majio spent 7 years in Georgia studying Georgian
language, scripture and grammar. Font "BPG Irubaqidze" is a modernized
replica of this casted type.

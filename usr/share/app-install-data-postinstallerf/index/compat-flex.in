This is legacy version of flex, a program that generates scanners.
Scanners are programs which can recognize lexical patterns in text.
Flex takes pairs of regular expressions and C code as input and
generates a C source file as output.  The output file is compiled and
linked with a library to produce an executable.  The executable
searches through its input for occurrences of the regular expressions.
When a match is found, it executes the corresponding C code.  Flex was
designed to work with both Yacc and Bison, and is used by many
programs as part of their build process.

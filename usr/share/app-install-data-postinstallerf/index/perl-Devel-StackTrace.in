Comment='<span size="xx-large">Perl module implementing stack trace and stack trace frame objects</span>'
Comment3='
The DevelStackTrace module contains two classes, DevelStackTrace
and DevelStackTraceFrame.  The goal of this object is to encapsulate
the information that can found through using the caller() function, as
well as providing a simple interface to this data.

The DevelStackTrace object contains a set of DevelStackTraceFrame
objects, one for each level of the stack.  The frames contain all the
data available from caller() as of Perl 5.6.0.

Bloom provides tools for releasing software on top of a git repository
and leverages tools and patterns from git-buildpackage. Additionally,
bloom leverages meta and build information from catkin
(https//github.com/ros/catkin) to automate release branching and the
generation of platform specific source packages, like debians src-debs.

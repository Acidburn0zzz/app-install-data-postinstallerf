Comment3='
Florence is an extensible scalable virtual keyboard for GNOME.
You need it if you cant use a real hardware keyboard, for
example because you are disabled, your keyboard is broken or
because you use a tablet PC, but you must be able to use a pointing
device (as a mouse, a trackball or a touchscreen).

Florence stays out of your way when you dont need it
it appears on the screen only when you need it.
A Timer-based auto-click functionality is available
to help disabled people having difficulties to click.

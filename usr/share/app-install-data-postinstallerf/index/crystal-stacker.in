If youve played Columns then you know what Crystal Stacker is all about. Match
3 or more of the same color crystals either horizontally, vertically, or dia-
gonally to destroy them. For every 45 crystals you destroy, the level increases
and the crystals fall faster. The higher the level, the more points you are
awarded for destroying crystals.

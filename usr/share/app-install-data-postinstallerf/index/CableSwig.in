CableSwig is used to create interfaces (i.e. "wrappers") to interpreted
languages such as Tcl and Python. It was created to produce wrappers for ITK
because the toolkit uses C++ structures that SWIG cannot parse (deeply nested
template instantiations). CableSwig is a combination tool that uses  GCC_XML as
the c++ parser. The input files are  Cable style input files. The XML produced
from the Cable/GCC_XML input files are then parsed and feed into a modified
version of  SWIG. SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs
written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages. It is
used to generate the language bindings to the target language. Currently, Tcl
and Python are supported.

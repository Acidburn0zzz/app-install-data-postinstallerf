Perl 5 has a lot of warts. Theres a lot of individual modules and techniques
out there to fix those warts. perl5i aims to pull the best of them together
into one module so you can turn them on all at once.

This includes adding features, changing existing core functions and changing
defaults. It will likely not be 100% backwards compatible with Perl 5, though
it will be 99%, perl5i will try to have a lexical effect.
Please add to this imaginary world and help make it real, either by telling
me what Perl looks like in your imagination

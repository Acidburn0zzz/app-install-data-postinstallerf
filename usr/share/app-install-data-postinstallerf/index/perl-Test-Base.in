Testing is usually the ugly part of Perl module authoring. Perl gives you a
standard way to run tests with TestHarness, and basic testing primitives
with TestMore. After that you are pretty much on your own to develop a
testing framework and philosophy. TestMore encourages you to make your
own framework by subclassing TestBuilder, but that is not trivial.

Comment3='
fig2ps is a perl script which converts xfig files to postscript or
PDF, using LaTeX for processing text (a capability not included in
transfig). This provides the benefit of seamless integration of
figures into documents (the font in the figures is the same as in the
text), and allows for special typesetting commands (such as
mathematical equations) to be included in figures.

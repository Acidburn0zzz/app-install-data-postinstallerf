This is an adapters and extras plugin for repoze.what.

The SQL plugin makes repoze.what support sources defined in SQLAlchemy-managed
databases by providing one group adapter, one permission adapter and one
utility to configure both in one go (optionally, when the group source and the
permission source have a relationship).
This plugin also defines repoze.what.plugins.quickstart.

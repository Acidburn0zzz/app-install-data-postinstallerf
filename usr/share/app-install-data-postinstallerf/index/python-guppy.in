Guppy-PE is a library and programming environment for Python, currently
providing in particular the Heapy subsystem, which supports object and heap
memory sizing, profiling and debugging. It also includes a prototypical
specification language, the Guppy Specification Language (GSL), which can be
used to formally specify aspects of Python programs and generate tests and
documentation from a common source.

Munge is a purposely-simple Java preprocessor. It only supports
conditional inclusion of source based on defined strings of the
form "if[tag]", "if_not[tag]", "else[tag]", and "end[tag]".
Unlike traditional preprocessors, comments, and formatting are all
preserved for the included lines. This is on purpose, as the output
of Munge will be distributed as human-readable source code.

To avoid creating a separate Java dialect, the conditional tags are
contained in Java comments. This allows one build to compile the
source files without pre-processing, to facilitate faster incremental

The "Littlewood-Richardson Calculator" is a package of C and Maple programs
for computing Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. The C programs form the
engine of the package, providing fast calculation of single LR coefficients,
products of Schur functions, and skew Schur functions. The Maple code mainly
gives an interface which makes it possible to use the C programs from Maple.
This interface uses the same notation as the SF package of John Stembridge,
to make it easier to use both packages at the same time.

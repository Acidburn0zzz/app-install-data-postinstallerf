Comment3='
An optional daemon (pmmgr) that manages a collection of pmlogger and
pmie daemons, for a set of discovered local and remote hosts running
the performance metrics collection daemon (pmcd).  It ensures these
daemons are running when appropriate, and manages their log rotation
needs (which are particularly complex in the case of pmlogger).
The base PCP package provides comparable functionality through cron
scripts which predate this daemon but do still provide effective and
efficient log management services.
The pcp-manager package aims to aggressively enable new PCP features
and as a result may not be suited to all production environments.

Comment3='
The cmap package provides character map tables, which make PDF
files generated by pdfLaTeX both searchable and copy-able in
acrobat reader and other compliant PDF viewers. Encodings
supported are OT1, T1, T2A, T2B, T2C and T5, together with LAE
(Arabic), LFE (Farsi) and LGR (Greek) and a variant OT1tt for
cmtt-like fonts. The packages main limitation currently is the
inability to work with virtual fonts, because of limitations of
pdfTeX. This restriction may be resolved in a future version of
pdfTeX.

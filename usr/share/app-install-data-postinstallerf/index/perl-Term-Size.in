*TermSize* is a Perl module which provides a straightforward way to
retrieve the terminal size.

Both functions take an optional filehandle argument, which defaults to
*STDIN{IO}. They both return a list of two values, which are the current
width and height, respectively, of the terminal associated with the
specified filehandle.
TermSizechars returns the size in units of characters, whereas
TermSizepixels uses units of pixels.

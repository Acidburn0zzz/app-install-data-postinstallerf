Comment3='
Resque is a Redis-backed Ruby library for creating background jobs, placing
those jobs on multiple queues, and processing them later.  Background jobs
can be any Ruby class or module that responds to perform. Your existing
classes can easily be converted to background jobs or you can create new
classes specifically to do work. Or, you can do both.
Resque is heavily inspired by DelayedJob and is comprised of three parts
* A Ruby library for creating, querying, and processing jobs
* A Rake task for starting a worker which processes jobs
* A Sinatra app for monitoring queues, jobs, and workers.

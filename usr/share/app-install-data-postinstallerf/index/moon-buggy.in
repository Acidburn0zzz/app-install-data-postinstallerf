Moon-buggy is a simple character graphics game where you drive some kind
of car across the moons surface. Unfortunately there are dangerous craters
there. Fortunately your car can jump over them!

The game has some resemblance of the classic arcade game moon-patrol which
was released in 1982. A clone of this game was relased for the Commodore
C64 in 1983. The present, ASCII art version of moon-buggy was written many
years later by Jochen Voss.

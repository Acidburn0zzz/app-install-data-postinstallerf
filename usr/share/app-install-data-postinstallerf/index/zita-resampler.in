zita-resampler is a C++ library for resampling audio signals. It is
designed to be used within a real-time processing context, to be fast,
and to provide high-quality sample rate conversion.

The library operates on signals represented in single-precision

output signals are assumed to be stored as interleaved samples.
The API allows a trade-off between quality and CPU load. For the
latter a range of approximately 16 is available. Even at the highest

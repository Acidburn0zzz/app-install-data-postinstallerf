Comment3='
The smartmontools package contains two utility programs (smartctl
and smartd) to control and monitor storage systems using the Self-
Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology System (SMART) built
into most modern ATA and SCSI hard disks. In many cases, these
utilities will provide advanced warning of disk degradation and
failure.

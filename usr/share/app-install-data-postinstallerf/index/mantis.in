Mantis is a free popular web-based issue tracking system.
It is written in the PHP scripting language and works with MySQL, MS SQL,
and PostgreSQL databases and a web server.
Almost any web browser should be able to function as a client.

Documentation can be found in /usr/share/doc/mantis
When the package has finished installing, you will need to perform some
additional configuration steps; these are described in
/usr/share/doc/mantis/README.Fedora

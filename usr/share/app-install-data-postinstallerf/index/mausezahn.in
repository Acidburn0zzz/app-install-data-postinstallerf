Mausezahn is a free fast traffic generator written in C which allows you to
send nearly every possible and impossible packet. Mausezahn can also be used
for example as didactical tool in network labs or for security audits including
penetration and DoS testing. As traffic generator Mausezahn is for example used
to test IP multicast or VoIP networks. Speeds close to the Ethernet limit are
reachable (depending on the HW platform).

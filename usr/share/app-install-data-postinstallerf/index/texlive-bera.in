The package contains the Bera Type 1 fonts, and a zip archive
containing files to use the fonts with LaTeX. Bera is a set of
three font families Bera Serif (a slab-serif Roman), Bera Sans
(a Frutiger descendant), and Bera Mono (monospaced/typewriter).
Support for use in LaTeX is also provided. The Bera family is a
repackaging, for use with TeX, of the Bitstream Vera family.

Comment3='
Flexmock is a testing library for Python that makes it easy to create mocks,
stubs and fakes. The API is inspired by a Ruby library of the same name, but
Python flexmock is not a clone of the Ruby version. It omits a number of
redundancies in the Ruby flexmock API, alters some defaults, and introduces
a number of Python-only features.

Comment3='
The <antunit> task drives the tests much like <junit> does for JUnit tests.

When called on a build file, the task will start a new Ant project for that
build file and scan for targets with names that start with "test". For each
such target it then will
   1. Execute the target named setUp, if there is one.
   2. Execute the target itself - if this target depends on other targets the
      normal Ant rules apply and the dependent targets are executed first.
   3. Execute the target names tearDown, if there is one.

A package built on the standard LaTeX graphics package to
perform all the different sorts of rotation one might like,
including complete figures and tables with their captions. If
you want continuous text (i.e., more than one page) set in
landscape mode, use the lscape package instead. The rotating
packages only deals in rotated boxes (or floats, which are
themselves boxes), and boxes always stay on one page. If you
need to use the facilities of the float in the same document,
load rotating.sty via rotfloat, which smooths the path between
the rotating and float packages.

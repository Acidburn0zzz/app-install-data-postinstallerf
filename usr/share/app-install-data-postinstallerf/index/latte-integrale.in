LattE (Lattice point Enumeration) is a computer software dedicated to
the problems of counting lattice points and integration inside convex
polytopes.  LattE contains the first ever implementation of Barvinoks
algorithm.  The LattE macchiato version (by M. K?ppe) incorporated
fundamental improvements and speed ups.  Now the latest version, LattE
integrale, has the ability to directly compute integrals of polynomial
functions over polytopes and in particular to do volume computations.

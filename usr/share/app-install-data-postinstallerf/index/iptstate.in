IP Tables State (iptstate) was originally written to implement
the "state top" feature of IP Filter in IP Tables. "State top"
displays the states held by your stateful firewall in a top-like
manner.

Since IP Tables doesnt have a built in way to easily display
this information even once, an option was added to just have it
display the state table once.

Comment3='
TDS is an open source 100% pure Java (type 4) JDBC 3.0 driver
for Microsoft SQL Server (6.5, 7, 2000,2005, and 2008) and
Sybase (10, 11, 12, 15). jTDS is based on FreeTDS and is currently the
fastest production-ready JDBC  driver for SQL Server and Sybase.
jTDS is 100% JDBC 3.0 compatible, supporting forward-only and
scrollable/updateable ResultSets, concurrent (completely
independent) Statements and implementing all the DatabaseMetaData and
ResultSetMetaData methods.

Flacon extracts individual tracks from one big audio file containing
the entire album of music and saves them as separate audio files. To do
this, it uses information from the appropriate CUE file. Besides, Flacon
makes it possible to conveniently revise or specify tags both for all
tracks at once or for each tag separately.

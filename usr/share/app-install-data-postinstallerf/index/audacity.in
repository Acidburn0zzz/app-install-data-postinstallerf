Audacity is a cross-platform multitrack audio editor. It allows you to
record sounds directly or to import files in various formats. It features
a few simple effects, all of the editing features you should need, and
unlimited undo. The GUI was built with wxWidgets and the audio I/O
supports PulseAudio, OSS and ALSA under Linux.

CryptoMiniSat is a SAT solver that aims to become a premiere SAT solver
with all the features and speed of successful SAT solvers, such as
MiniSat and PrecoSat.  The long-term goals of CryptoMiniSat are to be an
efficient sequential, parallel and distributed solver.  There are
solvers that are good at one or the other, e.g. ManySat (parallel) or
PSolver (distributed), but we wish to excel at all.

CryptoMiniSat 2.5 won the SAT Race 2010 among 20 solvers submitted by
researchers and industry.

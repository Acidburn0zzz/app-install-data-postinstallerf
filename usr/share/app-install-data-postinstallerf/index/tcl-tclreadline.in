The tclreadline package makes the GNU Readline library available
for interactive tcl shells. This includes history expansion and
file/command completion. Command completion for all tcl/tk commands
is provided and command completion for user defined commands can
be easily added. Tclreadline can also be used for tcl scripts which
want to use a shell like input interface.

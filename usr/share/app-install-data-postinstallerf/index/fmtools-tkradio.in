This package provides a GUI for fmtools, with lirc support.
The stations are read from the same files used by fmcontrol,
and the lirc configuration file is in $HOME/.fmlircrc

The script fmcontrol.py saves one from remembering frequencies
and volumes when using the "fm" program from fmtools.
All that it does is to tune into a station specified by name, at the
frequency and volume specified in $HOME/.fmrc or $HOME/.radiostations,
or the volume given on the command line.

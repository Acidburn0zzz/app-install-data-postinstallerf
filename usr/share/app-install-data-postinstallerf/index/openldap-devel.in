The openldap-devel package includes the development libraries and
header files needed for compiling applications that use LDAP
(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) internals. LDAP is a set of
protocols for enabling directory services over the Internet. Install
this package only if you plan to develop or will need to compile
customized LDAP clients.

pst-func is a package built for use with PSTricks. It provides
macros for plotting various mathematical functions -
polynomials and their derivatives f(x)=an*x^n+an-1*x^(n-
1)+...+a0 defined by the coefficients a0 a1 a2 ... and the
derivative order; - the Fourier sum f(x) = a0/2+a1cos(omega
x)+...+b1sin(omega x)+... defined by the coefficients a0 a1 a2
... b1 b2 b3 ...; - the Bessel function defined by its order; -
the Gauss function defined by sigma and mu; - Bezier curves
from order 1 (two control points) to order 9 (10 control
points); - the superellipse function (the Lame curve); -

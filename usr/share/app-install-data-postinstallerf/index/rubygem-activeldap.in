Comment3='
Ruby/ActiveLdap is a ruby extension library which provides a clean objected
oriented interface to the Ruby/LDAP library.  It was inspired by ActiveRecord.
This is not nearly as clean or as flexible as ActiveRecord, but it is still
trivial to define new objects and manipulate them with minimal difficulty.

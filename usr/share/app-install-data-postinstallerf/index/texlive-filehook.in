Comment3='
The package provides several file hooks (AtBegin, AtEnd, ...)
for files read by \input, \include and \InputIfFileExists.
General hooks for all such files (e.g. all \included ones) and
file specific hooks only used for named files are provided; two
before, and one after the final \clearpage.

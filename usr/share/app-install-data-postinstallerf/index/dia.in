The Dia drawing program can be used to draw different types of diagrams, and
includes support for UML static structure diagrams (class diagrams),
entity relationship modeling, and network diagrams.  Dia can load and
save diagrams to a custom file format, can load and save in .xml format,
and can export to PostScript(TM).

Escape is a tile-based puzzle game in the style of "Adventures of
Lolo" or "Chips Challenge." Unlike either of those games, Escape

Although Escape comes with hundreds of levels, the game places an
emphasis on the composition of new puzzles. Thus Escape has a
built-in level editor and facilities for automatically sharing
puzzles with other players.

Obnam is an easy, secure backup program. Backups can be stored on
local hard disks, or online via the SSH SFTP protocol. The backup
server, if used, does not require any special software, on top of SSH.

Some features that may interest you
 * Snapshot backups. Every generation looks like a complete snapshot,
   so you dont need to care about full versus incremental backups, or
   rotate real or virtual tapes.

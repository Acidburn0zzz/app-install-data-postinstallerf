Emesene is a MSN Messenger client writed in Python and
GTK. The main idea is to make a client similar to the official MSN
Messenger client but kepping it simple and with a nice GUI.

Emesene is a python/gtk MSN messenger clone, it uses msnlib (MSNP9)
and try to be a nice looking and simple MSN client.
You can login, send formated messages, smilies, use autoreply, change
status, change nick, send nudges and all the stuff you can do in a
normal MSN client except, file transfers,custom emoticons and display

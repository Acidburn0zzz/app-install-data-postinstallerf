Oauth2 was originally forked from Leah Culver and Andy Smiths oauth.py
code. Some of the tests come from a fork by Vic Fryzel, while a revamped
Request class and more tests were merged in from Mark Paschals fork. A
number of notable differences exist between this code and its forefathers

- 100% unit test coverage.
- The DataStore object has been completely ripped out. While creating unit
  tests for the library I found several substantial bugs with the
  implementation and confirmed with Andy Smith that it was never fully
  baked.

Comment3='
StAX2 is an experimental API that is intended to extend
basic StAX specifications in a way that allows implementations
to experiment with features before they end up in the actual
StAX specification (if they do). As such, it is intended
to be freely implementable by all StAX implementations same way
as StAX, but without going through a formal JCP process.

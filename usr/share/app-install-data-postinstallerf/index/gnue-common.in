GNU Enterprise Common Library for use with the GNUe tools provides
a set of images and classes that GNUe Forms, GNUe Reports, GNUe
Appserver and GNUe Designer and others depend upon.  It implements
a database-abstraction layer that provides support for most major
databases. A builtin XML-to-Object parser and Object-to-XML
marshaller are used by Forms, Reports, and Designer to save and
read Forms/Report definitions to and from an XML file. It also
defines and implements an RPC abstraction layer that will allow
server processes to define their public methods once and have them
available to CORBA, XML-RPC, SOAP, and DCOM clients.

SysUsage continuously monitor your systems informations and generate
periodical graph reports using rrdtool or javascript jqplot library.
All reports are shown throught a web interface.

SysUsage grabs all system activities using Sar and system commands allowing
you to keep tracks of your computer or server activity during his life.
It is a great help for performance analysis and resources management. The
threshold notification can alarm you when the system capabilities are
reached by sending SMTP messages or throught Nagios reports.

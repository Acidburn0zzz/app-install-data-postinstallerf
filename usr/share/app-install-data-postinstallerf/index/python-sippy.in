Comment3='
This ia a RFC3261-compliant Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Back-to-back
user agent (B2BUA) server software.

The B2BUA is a SIP call controlling component. Unlike a SIP proxy server,
which only maintains transaction state, the B2BUA maintains complete call
state and participates in all call requests. For this reason it can perform
number of functions that are not possible to implement using SIP proxy,
such as for example accurate call accounting, pre-paid rating and billing,
fail over call routing etc. Unlike PBX-type solutions such as Asterisk for
example, the B2BUA doesnt perform any media relaying or processing,

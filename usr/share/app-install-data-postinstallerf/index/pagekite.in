System for running publicly visible servers (generally web servers) on machines
without a direct connection to the Internet, such as mobile devices or
computers behind restrictive firewalls. It works around NAT, firewalls and
IP-address limitations by using a combination of  tunnels and reverse proxies.

Natively supported protocols HTTP, HTTPS
Partially supported protocols IRC, Finger
Any other TCP-based service, including SSH and VNC, may be exposed as well to
clients supporting HTTP Proxies.

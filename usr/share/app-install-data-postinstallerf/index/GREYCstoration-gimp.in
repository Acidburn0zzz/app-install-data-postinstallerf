GREYCstoration is an image regularization algorithm which is able to process
a color image by locally removing small variations of pixel intensities while
preserving significant global image features, such as edges and corners. The
most direct application of image regularization is image denoising. By
extension, it can also be used to inpaint or resize images.

This package contains the GREYCstoration plugin for gimp.

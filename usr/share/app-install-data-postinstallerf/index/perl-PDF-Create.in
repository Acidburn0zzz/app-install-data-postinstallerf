This module allows you to create PDF documents using a large number of
primitives, and emit the result as a PDF file or stream. PDF stands for
Portable Document Format.

Documents can have several pages, a table of content, an information section
and many other PDF elements. More functionalities will be added as needs arise.
Documents are constructed on the fly so the memory footprint is not tied to the
size of the pages but only to their number.

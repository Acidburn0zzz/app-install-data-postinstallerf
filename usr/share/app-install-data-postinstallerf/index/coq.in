Coq is a formal proof management system. It allows for the development
of theorems through first order logic that are mechanically checked by
the machine. Sets of definitions and theorems can be saved as compiled
modules and loaded into the system.

This package provides the main Coq binary without an optional IDE,
Coqide.

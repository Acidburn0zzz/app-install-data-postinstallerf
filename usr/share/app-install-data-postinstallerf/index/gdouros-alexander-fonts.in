A text typeface using the Greek letters designed by Alexander Wilson
(1714-1786), a Scottish doctor, astronomer, and typefounder, who established a
typefoundry in Glasgow in 1744. The type was especially designed for an edition
of Homer?s epics, published in 1756-8 by Andrew and Robert Foulis, printers to
the University of Glasgow. A modern revival, Wilson Greek, was designed by
Matthew Carter in 1995. Peter S. Baker is also using Wilson?s Greek type in his
Junicode font for medieval scholars (2007).

Latin and Cyrillic are based on a Garamond typeface. The font covers the
Windows Glyph List, IPA Extensions, Greek Extended, Ancient Greek Numbers,

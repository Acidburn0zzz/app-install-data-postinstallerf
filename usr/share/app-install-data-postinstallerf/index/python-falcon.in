Falcon is a high-performance Python framework for building cloud APIs.
It encourages the REST architectural style, and tries to do as little as
possible while remaining highly effective.

Features
- Intuitive routing via URI templates and resource classes
- Easy access to headers and bodies through request and response classes
- Idiomatic HTTP error responses via a handy exception base class
- DRY request processing using global, resource, and method hooks
- Snappy unit testing through WSGI helpers and mocks

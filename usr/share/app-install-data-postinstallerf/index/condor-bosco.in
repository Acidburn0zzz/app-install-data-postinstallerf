Comment3='
BOSCO allows a locally-installed Condor to submit jobs to remote clusters,
using SSH as a transit mechanism.  It is designed for cases where the remote
cluster is using a different batch system such as PBS, SGE, LSF, or another
Condor system.

BOSCO provides an overlay system so the remote clusters appear to be a Condor
cluster.  This allows the user to run their workflows using Condor tools across
multiple clusters.

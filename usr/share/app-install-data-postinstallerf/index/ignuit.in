Ignuit is a memorization aid based on the Leitner flashcard system. It has a
GNOME look and feel, a good selection of quiz options, and supports UTF-8. Cards
can include embedded audio, images, and mathematical formulae (via LaTeX). It
can import and export several file formats, including CSV. Ignuit can be used
for both long-term learning and cramming.

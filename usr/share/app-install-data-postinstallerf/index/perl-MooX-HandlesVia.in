Comment3='
MooXHandlesVia is an extension of Moos handles attribute
functionality. It provides a means of proxying functionality from an
external class to the given atttribute. This is most commonly used as a way
to emulate Native Trait behavior that has become commonplace in Moose
code, for which there was no Moo alternative.

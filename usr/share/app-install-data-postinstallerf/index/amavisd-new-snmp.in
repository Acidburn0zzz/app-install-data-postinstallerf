Comment3='
This package contains the program amavisd-snmp-subagent, which can be
used as a SNMP AgentX, exporting amavisd statistical counters database
(snmp.db) as well as a child process status database (nanny.db) to a
SNMP daemon supporting the AgentX protocol (RFC 2741), such as NET-SNMP.

It is similar to combined existing utility programs amavisd-agent and
amavisd-nanny, but instead of writing results as text to stdout, it
exports data to a SNMP server running on a host (same or remote), making
them available to SNMP clients (such a Cacti or mrtg) for monitoring or
alerting purposes.

Flare (Free Libre Action Roleplaying Engine) is a simple game engine built to
handle a very specific kind of game single-player 2D action RPGs. Flare is not
a re-implementation of an existing game or engine. It is a tribute to and
exploration of the action RPG genre.

Rather than building a very abstract, robust game engine, the goal of this
project is to build several real games and harvest an engine from the common,
reusable code. The first game, in progress, is a fantasy dungeon crawl.
Flare uses simple file formats (INI style config files) for most of the game

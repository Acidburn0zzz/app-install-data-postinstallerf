NLTK is a Python package that simplifies the construction of programs
that process natural language; and defines standard interfaces between
the different components of an NLP system.  It was designed primarily
to help teach graduate and undergraduate students about computational
linguistics; but it is also useful as a framework for implementing
research projects.

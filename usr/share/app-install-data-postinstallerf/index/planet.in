Comment3='
Planet is a flexible feed aggregator, this means that it downloads feeds
and aggregates their content together into a single combined feed with
the latest news first.

It uses Mark Pilgrims Ultra-liberal feed parser so can read from RDF, RSS
and Atom feeds and Tomas Styblos template library to output static files
in unlimited formats based on a series of templates.

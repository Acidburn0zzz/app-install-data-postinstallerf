There are a few ways to get a timestamp in your maven build. Unfortunately
most of them make you jump through giant hoops. This maven plugin makes it
as simple as 1-2-3 to create a timestamp at your disposal.
Also, it enables you to use the syntax of SimpleDateFormat to form custom
formatted dates.

Many modern text editors automatically save files using UTF-8 codification.
However, the perl interpreter does not expect it by default. Whilst this does
not represent a big deal on (most) backend-oriented programs, Web framework
(Catalyst, Mojolicious) based applications will suffer so-called Mojibake
(literally "unintelligible sequence of characters"). Even worse if an editor
saves BOM (Byte Order Mark, U+FEFF character in Unicode) at the start of a
script with the executable bit set (on Unix systems), it wont execute at all,
due to shebang corruption.

Avoiding codification problems is quite simple

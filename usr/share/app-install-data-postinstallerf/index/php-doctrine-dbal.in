Comment3='
The Doctrine database abstraction & access layer (DBAL) offers a lightweight
and thin runtime layer around a PDO-like API and a lot of additional, horizontal
features like database schema introspection and manipulation through an OO API.

The fact that the Doctrine DBAL abstracts the concrete PDO API away through the
use of interfaces that closely resemble the existing PDO API makes it possible
to implement custom drivers that may use existing native or self-made APIs. For
example, the DBAL ships with a driver for Oracle databases that uses the oci8
extension under the hood.

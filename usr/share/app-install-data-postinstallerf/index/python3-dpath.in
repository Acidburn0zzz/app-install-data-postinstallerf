Comment3='
A python library for accessing and searching dictionaries via /slashed/paths ala
xpath

Basically it lets you glob over a dictionary as if it were a filesystem. It
allows you to specify globs (ala the bash eglob syntax, through some advanced
fnmatch.fnmatch magic) to access dictionary elements, and provides some facility
for filtering those results.

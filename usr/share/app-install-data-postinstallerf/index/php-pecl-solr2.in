Comment3='
It effectively simplifies the process of interacting with Apache Solr using
PHP5 and it already comes with built-in readiness for the latest features.

The extension has features such as built-in, serializable query string builder
objects which effectively simplifies the manipulation of name-value pair
request parameters across repeated requests.
The response from the Solr server is also automatically parsed into native php
objects whose properties can be accessed as array keys or object properties
without any additional configuration on the client-side.

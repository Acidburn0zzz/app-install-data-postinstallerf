Snap is a simple and fast web development framework and server written in
Haskell. For more information, you can visit the Snap project website at
<http//snapframework.com/>.

The Snap HTTP server is a high performance, epoll-enabled, iteratee-based web
server library written in Haskell. Together with the snap-core library upon
which it depends, it provides a clean and efficient Haskell programming
interface to the HTTP protocol.

Comment3='
  hKit is a simple toolkit for extracting common microformats from a page.
The page can be presented as a string or a URL, and the result is handed
back as a standard PHP array structure. hKit uses SimpleXML for parsing,
and therefore requires PHP5.
  Designed for humans first and machines second, microformats are a set of
simple, open data formats built upon existing and widely adopted standards.
  The only microformat module currently supported by hKit is hCard. However,
hKit makes possible for a user to write its own microformat module.

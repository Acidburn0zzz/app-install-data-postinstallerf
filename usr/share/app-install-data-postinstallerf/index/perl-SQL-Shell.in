SQLShell is a command-interpreter API for building shells and batch
scripts. A command-line interface with readline support is included
as part of the CPAN distribution. See <SQLShellManual> for a user
guide. SQLShell offers features similar to the mysql or sql*plus
client programs but is database independent.

This package provides the backend SQLShell libraries.  For the
command-line interperter (sqlsh), please also install the sqlsh package.

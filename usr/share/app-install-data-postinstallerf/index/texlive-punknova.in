Comment3='
The font was generated from a MetaPost version of the sources
of the original punk font. Knuths original fonts generated
different shapes at random. This isnt actually possible in an
OpenType font; rather, the font contains several variants of
each glyph, and uses the OpenType randomize function to select
a variant for each invocation.

TORQUE (Tera-scale Open-source Resource and QUEue manager) is a resource
manager providing control over batch jobs and distributed compute nodes.
TORQUE is based on OpenPBS version 2.3.12 and incorporates scalability,
fault tolerance, and feature extension patches provided by USC, NCSA, OSC,
the U.S. Dept of Energy, Sandia, PNNL, U of Buffalo, TeraGrid, and many
other leading edge HPC organizations.

This package includes the header files and static libraries
necessary for developing programs which will use torque.

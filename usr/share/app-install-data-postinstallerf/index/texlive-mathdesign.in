The Math Design project offers free mathematical fonts that
match with existing text fonts. To date, three free font
families are available Adobe Utopia, URW Garamond and
Bitstream Charter. Three commercial fonts are also supported
Adobe Garamond Pro, Adobe UtopiaStd and ITC Charter. Mathdesign
covers the whole LaTeX glyph set, including AMS symbols and
some extra. Both roman and bold versions of these symbols can
be used. Moreover you can choose between three greek fonts (two
of them created by the Greek Font Society).

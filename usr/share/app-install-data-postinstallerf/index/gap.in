GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra, with particular
language, a library of thousands of functions implementing algebraic
algorithms written in the GAP language as well as large data libraries
of algebraic objects.  GAP is used in research and teaching for studying
groups and their representations, rings, vector spaces, algebras,
combinatorial structures, and more.

This is a metapackage that requires the standard GAP components.

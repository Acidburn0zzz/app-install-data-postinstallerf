Comment3='
FontTTFMetrics encapsulates the font metrics of a true type font file. A
true type font file contains several tables which need to be parsed before
any useful information could be gathered about the font. There is the
excellent module for parsing TTF font in CPAN by Martin Hosken, FontTTF.
But in my opinion the use of FontTTF requires intimate knowledge of TTF
font format. This module was written to support the use of TTF in Pastel 2D
graphics library in Perl. Three factors prompted me to write this module
first, I required a fast module to access TTF file. Second, all the access
required was read-only. Last, I wanted a user friendly, higher level API to
access TTF file.

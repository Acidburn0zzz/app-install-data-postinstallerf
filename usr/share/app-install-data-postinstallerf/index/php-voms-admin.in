PHP VOMS-Admin (PVA) originally implemented the same functions as the
traditional JAVA-based VOMS-Admin (v.2.0.18) interface for Apache
Tomcat. It was designed to be more flexible and stable, provide easy
scalability and minimize resource usage. PVA is fully compatible with
the vomsd mysql backend.

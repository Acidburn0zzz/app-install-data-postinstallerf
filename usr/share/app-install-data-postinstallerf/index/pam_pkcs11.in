Comment3='
This Linux-PAM login module allows a X.509 certificate based user
authentication. The certificate and its dedicated private key are thereby
accessed by means of an appropriate PKCS #11 module. For the
verification of the users certificates, locally stored CA
certificates as well as either online or locally accessible CRLs and
OCSP are used. This version uses NSS to validate the Certificates and manage
the PKCS #11 smartCards.
Additional included pam_pkcs11 related tools

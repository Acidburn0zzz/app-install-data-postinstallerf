Comment3='
The package was inspired by the cooltooltips package. In
contrast to cooltooltips, fancytooltips allows inclusion of
tooltips which contain arbitrary TeX material or a series of
TeX materials (animated graphics) from an external PDF file. To
see the tooltips, you have to open the files in Adobe Reader.
The links and JavaScripts are inserted using eforms package
from the AcroTeX bundle.

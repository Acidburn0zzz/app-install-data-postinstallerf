Comment3='
Headers and linker scripts for the Texas Instruments MSP430 range of
micro-controllers.  These headers provide the location of all the
special function registers of the micro-controllers.  The linker
scripts provide the mapping of those registers into memory as well as
information on where code should be loaded.

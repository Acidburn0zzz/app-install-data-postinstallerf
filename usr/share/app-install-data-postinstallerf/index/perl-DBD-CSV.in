Comment3='
The DBDCSV module is yet another driver for the DBI (Database
independent interface for Perl). This one is based on the SQL
"engine" SQLStatement and the abstract DBI driver DBDFile
and implements access to so-called CSV files (Comma separated
values). Such files are mostly used for exporting MS Access and
MS Excel data.

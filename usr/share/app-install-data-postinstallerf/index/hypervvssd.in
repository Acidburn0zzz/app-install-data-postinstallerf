Hypervvssd is an implementation of HyperV VSS functionality
for Linux. The daemon is used for host initiated guest snapshot
on HyperV hypervisor. The daemon first registers with the
kernel driver. After this is done it waits for instructions
from Windows Host if to "freeze" or "thaw" the filesystem
on the Linux Guest.

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It features
support for computer and literary braille, supports contracted and uncontracted
translation for many, many languages and has support for hyphenation.
New languages can easily be added through tables that support a rule- or
dictionary based approach. Liblouis also supports math braille
(Nemeth and Marburg).

Liblouis is based on the translation routines in the BRLTTY screenreader for
Linux. It has, however, gone far beyond these routines.
The library is named in honor of Louis Braille.

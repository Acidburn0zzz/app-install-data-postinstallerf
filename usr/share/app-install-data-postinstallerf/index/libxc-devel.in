libxc is a library of exchange and correlation functionals. Its purpose is to
be used in codes that implement density-functional theory. For the moment, the
library includes most of the local density approximations (LDAs), generalized
density approximation (GGAs), and meta-GGAs. The library provides values for
the energy density and its 1st, 2nd, and (for the LDAs) 3rd derivatives.

This package contains the development headers and library that are necessary
in order to compile programs against libxc.

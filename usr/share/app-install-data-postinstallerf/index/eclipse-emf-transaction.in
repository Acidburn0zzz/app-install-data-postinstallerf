The transaction component provide support for clients to read and write EMF
models on multiple threads, provides automatic validation to detect invalid
changes and provides support for batched notification of related changes,
rather than as a stream of EMF notifications. In particular, this allows
applications to analyze change sets in their entirety. For a simplified
programming model, the API automatically tracks changes applied to models
without the need for client code to use EMF edit commands. These changes are
encapsulated in transactions/operations that can undo and redo themselves.

The validation component provides an API for defining constraints for any EMF
meta-model (batch and live constraints), provides an extensibility API to
support meta-models that require custom strategies for model traversal and
provides support for parsing the content of constraint elements defined in
specific languages. The validation framework provides support for two
languages Java and OCL. It also provides API support to define "client
contexts" that describe the objects that need to be validated and to bind them
to constraints that need to be enforced on these objects and provides support
for listening to validation events.

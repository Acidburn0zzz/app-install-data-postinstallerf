The successor to LBrickBuster offers you a new challenge in more than 50 levels
with loads of new bonuses (goldshower, joker, explosive balls, bonus magnet
...), maluses (chaos, darkness, weak balls, malus magnet ...) and special
bricks (growing bricks, explosive bricks, regenerative bricks ...). If you
are still hungry for more after that you can create your own levelsets with
the integrated level editor.

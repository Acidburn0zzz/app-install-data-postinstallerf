Comment3='
EventExecFlow offers a high level API to declare jobs, which mainly execute
external commands, parse their output to get progress or other status
information, triggers actions when the command has been finished etc. Such jobs
can be chained together in a recursive fashion to fulfill rather complex tasks
which consist of many jobs.

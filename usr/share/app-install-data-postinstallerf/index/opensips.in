Comment3='
OpenSIPS or Open SIP Server is a very fast and flexible SIP (RFC3261)
proxy server. Written entirely in C, opensips can handle thousands calls
per second even on low-budget hardware. A C Shell like scripting language
provides full control over the servers behaviour. Its modular
architecture allows only required functionality to be loaded.
Currently the following modules are available digest authentication,
CPL scripts, instant messaging, MySQL and UNIXODBC support, a presence agent,
radius authentication, record routing, an SMS gateway, a jabber gateway, a
transaction and dialog module, OSP module, statistics support,
registrar and user location.

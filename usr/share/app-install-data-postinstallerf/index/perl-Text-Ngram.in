n-Gram analysis is a field in textual analysis which uses sliding window
character sequences in order to aid topic analysis, language determination
and so on. The n-gram spectrum of a document can be used to compare and
filter documents in multiple languages, prepare word prediction networks,
and perform spelling correction.

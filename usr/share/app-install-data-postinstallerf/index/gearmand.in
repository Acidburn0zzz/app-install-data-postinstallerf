Gearman provides a generic framework to farm out work to other machines
or dispatch function calls to machines that are better suited to do the work.
It allows you to do work in parallel, to load balance processing, and to
call functions between languages. It can be used in a variety of applications,
from high-availability web sites to the transport for database replication.
In other words, it is the nervous system for how distributed processing
communicates.

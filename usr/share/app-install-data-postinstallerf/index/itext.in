iText is a library that allows you to generate PDF files on the fly. The iText
classes are very useful for people who need to generate read-only, platform
independent documents containing text, lists, tables and images. The library is
especially useful in combination with Java(TM) technology-based Servlets The
look and feel of HTML is browser dependent; with iText and PDF you can control
exactly how your servlets output will look.

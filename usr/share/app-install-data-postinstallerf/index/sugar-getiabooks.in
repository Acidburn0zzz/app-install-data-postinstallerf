This Activity will use the Advanced Search capabilities of the
Internet Archive website to enable browsing the websites catalog,
getting information on the books therein, and downloading these
books to the Journal. Its user interface is similar to the offline
catalog search of Read Etexts, but where that Activity is used for
both getting books and reading them this one will concern itself
only with getting the books, so they may be read with the Read
Activity.

Eucalyptus is a service overlay that implements elastic computing
using existing resources. The goal of Eucalyptus is to allow sites
with existing clusters and server infrastructure to co-host an elastic
computing service that is interface-compatible with Amazon AWS.

This package contains the node controller part of eucalyptus. This
component handles instances.

NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is an interface for array-oriented
data access and a freely-distributed collection of software libraries
for C, Fortran, C++, and perl that provides an implementation of the
interface.  The NetCDF library also defines a machine-independent
format for representing scientific data.  Together, the interface,
library, and format support the creation, access, and sharing of
scientific data. The NetCDF software was developed at the Unidata
Program Center in Boulder, Colorado.

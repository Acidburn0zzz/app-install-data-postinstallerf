Zend\Uri is a component that aids in manipulating and validating Uniform
Resource Identifiers (URIs) [1]. Zend\Uri exists primarily to service other
components, such as Zend\Http\, but is also useful as a standalone utility.

URIs always begin with a scheme, followed by a colon. The construction of the
many different schemes varies significantly. The Zend\Uri component provides
the Zend\Uri\UriFactory that returns a class implementing the
Zend\Uri\UriInterface which specializes in the scheme if such a class is
registered with the Factory.

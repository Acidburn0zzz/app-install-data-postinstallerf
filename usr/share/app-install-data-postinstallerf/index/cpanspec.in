Comment3='
cpanspec generates spec files (and, optionally, source or even binary
packages) for Perl modules from CPAN for Fedora.  The quality of the spec
file is our primary concern.  It is assumed that maintainers will need to
do some (hopefully small) amount of work to clean up the generated spec
file to make the package build and to verify that all of the information
contained in the spec file is correct.

An advanced letter document class which extends LaTeXs usual
letter class, providing support for building your own
letterhead and marking fold points for window envelopes.
Options supported by the package include letterpaper for US
letter; a4offset for a modified A4 layout suitable for platic
binders that cover a part of the left margin. The classs
handling of dates has inspired an extended version of date-
handling in the isodate package. The class supersedes an
earlier class called myletter.

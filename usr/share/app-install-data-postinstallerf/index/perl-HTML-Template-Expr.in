Comment3='
This module provides an extension to HTMLTemplate which allows
expressions in the template syntax.  This is purely an addition - all
the normal HTMLTemplate options, syntax and behaviors will still
work.  Expression support includes comparisons, math operations,
string operations and a mechanism to allow you add your own functions
at runtime.

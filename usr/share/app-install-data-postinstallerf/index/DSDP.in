DSDP is a free open source implementation of an interior-point method
for semidefinite programming.  It provides primal and dual solutions,
exploits low-rank structure and sparsity in the data, and has relatively
low memory requirements for an interior-point method.  It allows
feasible and infeasible starting points and provides approximate
certificates of infeasibility when no feasible solution exists.  The
dual-scaling algorithm implemented in this package has a convergence
proof and worst-case polynomial complexity under mild assumptions on the
data.  The software can be used as a set of subroutines, through Matlab,
or by reading and writing to data files.  Furthermore, the solver offers

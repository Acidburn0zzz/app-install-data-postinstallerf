NSS Softoken Cryptographic Module Freebl Library Development Tools
This package supports special needs of some PKCS #11 module developers and
is otherwise considered private to NSS. As such, the programming interfaces
may change and the usual NSS binary compatibility commitments do not apply.
Developers should rely only on the officially supported NSS public API.

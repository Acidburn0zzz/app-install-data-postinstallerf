Comment3='
Emacs is an advanced and extensible editor. An Emacs major mode customizes Emacs
for editing particular types of text documents. PSGML is a major mode for SGML
(a markup language) documents.  PSGML provides several functionalities for
editing SGML documents indentation according to element nesting depth and
identification of structural errors (but it is not a validating SGML parser);
menus and commands for inserting tags with only the contextually valid tags;
attribute values can be edited in a separate window with information about types
and defaults; structure based editing includes movement and killing; and also
several commands for folding editing.

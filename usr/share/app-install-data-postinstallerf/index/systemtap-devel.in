This package contains the components needed to compile a systemtap
script from source form into executable (.ko) forms.  It may be
installed on a self-contained developer workstation (along with the
systemtap-client and systemtap-runtime packages), or on a dedicated
remote server (alongside the systemtap-server package).  It includes
a copy of the standard tapset library and the runtime library C files.

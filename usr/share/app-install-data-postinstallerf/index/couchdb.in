Comment3='
Apache CouchDB is a distributed, fault-tolerant and schema-free
document-oriented database accessible via a RESTful HTTP/JSON API.
Among other features, it provides robust, incremental replication
with bi-directional conflict detection and resolution, and is
queryable and indexable using a table-oriented view engine with
JavaScript acting as the default view definition language.

Imlib is a display depth independent image loading and rendering library.
Imlib is designed to simplify and speed up the process of loading images and
obtaining X Window System drawables. Imlib provides many simple manipulation
routines which can be used for common operations.

The imlib package also contains the imlib_config program, which you can use to
configure the Imlib image loading and rendering library. Imlib_config can be
used to control how Imlib uses color and handles gamma corrections, etc.

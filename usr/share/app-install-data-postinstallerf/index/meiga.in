Meiga is a lightweight, easy to use, network friendly and also
application friendly content server for desktop.
Client side does not need to install any software, as the
shared files can be accessed using web browser. The ultimate
goal is to serve as a common publishing point for desktop
applications, such as file manager, picture viewers or
music players

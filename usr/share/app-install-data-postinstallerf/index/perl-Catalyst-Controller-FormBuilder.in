Comment3='
This base controller merges the functionality of CGIFormBuilder with
Catalyst and the following templating systems Template Toolkit, Mason and
HTMLTemplate. This gives you access to all of FormBuilders niceties,
such as controllablefield stickiness, multilingual support, and Javascript
generation. For more details, see CGIFormBuilder or the website at
http//www.formbuilder.org

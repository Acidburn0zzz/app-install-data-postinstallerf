vnStat is a console-based network traffic monitor that keeps a log of daily
network traffic for the selected interface(s). vnStat isnt a packet sniffer.
The traffic information is analyzed from the /proc-filesystem, so vnStat can
be used without root permissions. See the webpage for few screenshots.

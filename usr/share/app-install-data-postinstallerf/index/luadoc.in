LuaDoc is a documentation generator tool for Lua source code. It parses the
declarations and documentation comments in a set of Lua source files and
produces a set of XHTML pages describing the commented declarations and
functions.

The output is not limited to XHTML. Other formats can be generated by
implementing new doclets. The format of the documentation comments is also
flexible and can be customized by implementing new taglets.

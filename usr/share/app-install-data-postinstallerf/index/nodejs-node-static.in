Comment3='
node-static is a simple, "rfc 2616 compliant" file streaming module
for node.

node-static has an in-memory file cache, making it highly efficient.
node-static understands and supports "conditional GET" and "HEAD" requests.
node-static was inspired by some of the other static-file serving modules
out there, such as node-paperboy and antinode.

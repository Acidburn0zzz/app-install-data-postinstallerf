PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management system (DBMS).
The base postgresql package contains the client programs that youll need to
access a PostgreSQL DBMS server, as well as HTML documentation for the whole
system.  These client programs can be located on the same machine as the
PostgreSQL server, or on a remote machine that accesses a PostgreSQL server
over a network connection.  The PostgreSQL server can be found in the
postgresql-server sub-package.

Comment3='
fedmsg <http//fedmsg.com> is a set of tools for knitting together
services and webapps into a realtime messaging net. This package contains
metadata provider plugins for the Debian deployment of that system.

If you were to deploy fedmsg at another site, you would like want to write
your own module like this one that could provide textual representations of
your messages.

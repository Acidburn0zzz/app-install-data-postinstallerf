The goal of the savetrees package is to pack as much text as
possible onto each page of a LaTeX document. Admittedly, this
makes the document far less attractive. Nevertheless, savetrees
is a simple way to save paper when printing draft copies of a
document. It can also be useful when trying to meet a tight
page-length requirement for a conference or journal submission.

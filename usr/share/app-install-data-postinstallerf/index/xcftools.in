Xcftools is a set of fast command-line tools for extracting information from
the Gimps native file format XCF. The tools are designed to allow efficient
use of layered XCF files as sources in a build system that use make and
similar tools to manage automatic processing of the graphics.
These tools work independently of the Gimp engine and do not require
the Gimp to even be installed.

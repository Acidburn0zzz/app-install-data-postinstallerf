Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications.

Twisted Words contains implementations of many Instant Messaging protocols,
including IRC, Jabber, MSN, OSCAR (AIM & ICQ), TOC (AOL), and some
functionality for creating bots, inter-protocol gateways, and a client
application for many of the protocols.
In support of Jabber, Twisted Words also contains X-ish, a library for
processing XML with Twisted and Python, with support for a Pythonic DOM and
an XPath-like toolkit.

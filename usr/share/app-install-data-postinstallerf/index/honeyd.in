Honeyd is a small daemon that creates virtual hosts on a network.
The hosts can be configured to run arbitrary services, and their
TCP personality can be adapted so that they appear to be running
certain versions of operating systems. Honeyd enables a single
host to claim multiple addresses on a LAN for network simulation.

Comment3='
The vision of the Social Semantic Desktop defines a user?s personal
information environment as a source and end-point of the Semantic Web
Knowledge workers comprehensively express their information and data
with respect to their own conceptualizations.

Semantic Web languages and protocols are used to formalize these
conceptualizations and for coordinating local and global information
access. The Resource Description Framework serves as a common data
representation format. With a particular focus on addressing certain
limitations of RDF, a novel representational language akin to RDF and
the Web Ontology Language, plus a number of other high-level
ontologies were created.
Together, they provide a means to build the semantic bridges necessary
for data exchange and application integration on distributed social
semantic desktops. Although initially designed to fulfill requirements
for the Nepomuk project, these ontologies are useful for the semantic
web community in general.

You take command in the game of a bunch of small penguins
and have to guide them around in levels. Since the penguins
walk on their own, the player can only influence them by giving them commands,
like build a bridge, dig a hole or redirect all penguins in the other
direction. The goal of each level is to reach the exit, for which multiple
combination of commands are necessary. The game is presented in a 2D site view.

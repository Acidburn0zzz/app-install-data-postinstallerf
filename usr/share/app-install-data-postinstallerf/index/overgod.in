For too long has humanity been ruled by cruel and disputatious gods!
Fly through the various layers of the Celestial Oversphere to unseat
those who control the universe.

In Overgod you control a little vehicle in the middle of the screen and fly
around and shoot things - a bit like asteroids, but the asteroids move
independently and shoot back. You can also upgrade your vehicle in various
ways.

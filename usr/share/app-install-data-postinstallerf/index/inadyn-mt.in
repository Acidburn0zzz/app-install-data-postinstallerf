INADYN-MT is a dynamic DNS client. It maintains the IP address of
a host name. It periodically checks wheather the IP address stored
by the DSN server is the real current address of the machine that
is running INADYN-MT.

Before using inadyn-mt for the first time you must use the DynDNS
providers web interface to create the entry for the hostname. You
should then fill in /etc/inadyn.conf with the appropriate detail

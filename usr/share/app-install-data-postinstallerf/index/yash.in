Yash is a command line shell that conforms to the POSIX.1 (IEEE Std
1003.1, 2008 Edition) standard for the most part.

Yash also has its own features beyond POSIX, such as
  * global aliases
  * random numbers
  * socket redirections and other special redirections
  * right prompt
  * command completion

The Apache/SELinux plus is an extra module (mod_selinux.so) which enables
to launch contents-handler (it means both of references to static contents
and invocations of web applications) with individual and restrictive
privileges set, based on http authentication.
The mod_selinux.so generates a one-time worker thread for each request,
and it assigns the worker restrictive domain based on the authentication
prior to launching contents handlers.
It means we can apply valid access controls on web-applications, and
makes assurance operating system can prevent violated accesses, even if
web application contains security bugs or vulnerabilities.

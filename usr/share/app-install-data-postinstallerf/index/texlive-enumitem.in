Comment3='
This package provides user control over the layout of the three
basic list environments enumerate, itemize and description. It
supersedes both enumerate and mdwlist (providing well-
structured replacements for all their funtionality), and in
addition provides functions to compute the layout of labels,
and to clone the standard environments, to create new
environments with counters of their own.

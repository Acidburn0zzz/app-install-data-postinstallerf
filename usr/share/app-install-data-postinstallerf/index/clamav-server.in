ATTENTION most users do not need this package; the main package has
everything (or depends on it) which is needed to scan for virii on
workstations.

This package contains files which are needed to execute the clamd-daemon.
This daemon does not provide a system-wide service. Instead of, an instance
of this daemon should be started for each service requiring it.
See the README file how this can be done with a minimum of effort.

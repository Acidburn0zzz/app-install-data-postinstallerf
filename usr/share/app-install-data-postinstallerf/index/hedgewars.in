Comment3='
Hedgewars is a turn based strategy game but the real buzz is from watching the
devastation caused by those pesky hedgehogs with those fantastic weapons.

Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the course of the
game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They then use whatever
tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents hedgehogs,
thereby winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety
of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools
such as the "Rope" or "Parachute", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas.

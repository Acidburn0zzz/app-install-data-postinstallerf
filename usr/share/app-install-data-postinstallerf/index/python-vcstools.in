The vcstools module provides a Python API for interacting with different
version control systems (VCS/SCMs). The VcsClient class provides an API
for seamless interacting with Git, Mercurial (Hg), Bzr and SVN. The focus
of the API is manipulating on-disk checkouts of source-controlled trees.
Its main use is to support the rosinstall tool.

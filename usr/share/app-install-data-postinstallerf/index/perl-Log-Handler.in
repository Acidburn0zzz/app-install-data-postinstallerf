This module is a object oriented handler for logging, tracing and debugging.
It is very easy to use and provides a simple interface for multiple output
objects with lots of configuration parameters. You can easily filter the
amount of logged information on a per-output base, define priorities, create
patterns to format the messages and reload the complete logging machine.

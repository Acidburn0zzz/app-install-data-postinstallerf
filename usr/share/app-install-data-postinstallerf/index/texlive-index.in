This is a reimplementation of LaTeXs indexing macros to
provide better support for indexing. For example, it supports
multiple indexes in a single document and provides a more
robust \index command. It supplies short hand notations for the
\index command (^{word}) and a * variation of \index
(abbreviated _{word}) that prints the word being indexed, as
well as creating an index entry for it.

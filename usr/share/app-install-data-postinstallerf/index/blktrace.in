Comment3='
blktrace is a block layer IO tracing mechanism which provides detailed
information about request queue operations to user space.  This package
includes both blktrace, a utility which gathers event traces from the kernel;
and blkparse, a utility which formats trace data collected by blktrace.

You should install the blktrace package if you need to gather detailed
information about IO patterns.

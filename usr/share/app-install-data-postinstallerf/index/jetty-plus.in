Jetty is a 100% Java HTTP Server and Servlet Container. This means that you
do not need to configure and run a separate web server (like Apache) in order
to use Java, servlets and JSPs to generate dynamic content. Jetty is a fully
featured web server for static and dynamic content. Unlike separate
server/container solutions, this means that your web server and web
application run in the same process, without interconnection overheads
and complications. Furthermore, as a pure java component, Jetty can be simply
included in your application for demonstration, distribution or deployment.
Jetty is available on all Java supported platforms.

Comment3='
The core idea of libee is to provide a small but hopefully convenient API layer
above the CEE standard. CEE is under heavy development and even some of its
core data structures have not been fully specified.

CEE is an upcoming standard used to describe network events in a number of
normalized formats. Its goal is to unify many different
representations that exist in the industry.

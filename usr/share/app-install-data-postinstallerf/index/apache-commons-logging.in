The commons-logging package provides a simple, component oriented
interface (org.apache.commons.logging.Log) together with wrappers for
logging systems. The user can choose at runtime which system they want
to use. In addition, a small number of basic implementations are
provided to allow users to use the package standalone.
commons-logging was heavily influenced by Avalons Logkit and Log4J. The
commons-logging abstraction is meant to minimize the differences between
the two, and to allow a developer to not tie himself to a particular
logging implementation.

Durus is a persistent object system for applications written in the Python
programming language. It offers an easy way to use and maintain a consistent
collection of object instances used by one or more processes. Access and change
of a persistent instances is managed through a cached Connection instance which
includes commit() and abort() methods so that changes are transactional.
Durus is best suited to collections of less than a million instances with
relatively stable state.

Comment3='
libmwaw contains import filters for many old mac documents, mostly text
formats like ClarisWorks, MacWrite or MS Word for Mac, but it has a
limited support for vector drawings and spreadsheets as well (limited in
the sense that it treats them as text documents). Full list of supported
formats is available at https//sourceforge.net/p/libmwaw/wiki/Home/ .

NorduGrid is a collaboration aiming at development, maintenance and
support of the free Grid middleware, known as the Advanced Resource
Connector (ARC).

This package contains the LDAP based information system for ARC.
This package is not self-contained. it should be pulled in by either
nordugrid-arc-arex to be a part of a local information system or by
nordugrid-arc-egiis to be a part of a EGIIS service.

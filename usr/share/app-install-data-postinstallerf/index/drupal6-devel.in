A suite of modules containing fun for module developers and themers.

Devel
* Helper functions for Drupal developers and inquisitive admins. This module can
  print a summary of all database queries for each page request at the bottom of
  each page. The summary includes how many times each query was executed on a
  page (shouldnt run same query multiple times), and how long each query took
  (short is good - use cache for complex queries).
* Also a dprint_r($array) function is provided, which pretty prints arrays.
  Useful during development. Similarly, a ddebug_backtrace() is offerred.

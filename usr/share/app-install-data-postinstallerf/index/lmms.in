LMMS aims to be a free alternative to popular (but commercial and
closed- source) programs like FruityLoops/FL Studio, Cubase and Logic
allowing you to produce music with your computer. This includes
creation of loops, synthesizing and mixing sounds, arranging samples,
having fun with your MIDI-keyboard and much more...

LMMS combines the features of a tracker-/sequencer-program and those
of powerful synthesizers, samplers, effects etc. in a modern,
user-friendly and easy to use graphical user-interface.

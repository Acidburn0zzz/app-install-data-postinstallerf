Comment3='
check_openmanage is a plugin for Nagios which checks the hardware
health of Dell servers running OpenManage Server Administrator
(OMSA). The plugin can be used remotely with SNMP or locally with
NRPE, check_by_ssh or similar, whichever suits your needs and
particular taste. The plugin checks the health of the storage
subsystem, power supplies, memory modules, temperature probes etc.,
and gives an alert if any of the components are faulty or operate
outside normal parameters.

The Linux Standard Base (LSB) CXX module supports the core interfaces by
providing system interfaces, libraries, and a runtime environment for
applications built using the C++ programming language. These interfaces
provide low-level support for the core constructs of the language, and
implement the standard base C++ libraries.

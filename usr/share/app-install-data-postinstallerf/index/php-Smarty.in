Although Smarty is known as a "Template Engine", it would be more accurately
described as a "Template/Presentation Framework." That is, it provides the
programmer and template designer with a wealth of tools to automate tasks
commonly dealt with at the presentation layer of an application. I stress the
word Framework because Smarty is not a simple tag-replacing template engine.
Although it can be used for such a simple purpose, its focus is on quick and
painless development and deployment of your application, while maintaining
high-performance, scalability, security and future growth.

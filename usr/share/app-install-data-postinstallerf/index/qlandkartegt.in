QLandkarte GT is the ultimate outdoor aficionados tool for GPS maps in
GeoTiff format as well as Garmins img vector map format. Additional it is
the PC side frontend to QLandkarte M, a moving map application for mobile
devices. And it fills the gap Garmin leaves in refusing to support Linux.
QLandkarte GT is the proof that writing portable applications for Unix,
Windows and OSX is feasible with a minimum of overhead. No excuses!

QLandkarte GT does replace the original QLandkarte with a much more
flexible architecture. Its not limited to a map format or device. Thus
if you think your Magellan GPS or other should be supported, join the team.

This is the configuration file for the security yum-cron update service, which
lives here /etc/yum/yum-cron-security.conf
Install this package if you want automatic yum security updates once a day
confusing if its not security updates anymore though).
By default this will download and _apply_ the security updates, unlike
yum-cron-daily which will just download all updates by default.
This runs after yum-cron-daily, if that is installed.

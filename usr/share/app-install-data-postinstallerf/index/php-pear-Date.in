Comment3='
Generic classes for representation and manipulation of dates, times and time
zones without the need of timestamps, which is a huge limitation for php
programs. Includes time zone data, time zone conversions and many date/time
conversions.  It does not rely on 32-bit system date stamps, so you can display
calendars and compare dates that date pre 1970 and post 2038. This package also
provides a class to convert date strings between Gregorian and Human calendar
formats.

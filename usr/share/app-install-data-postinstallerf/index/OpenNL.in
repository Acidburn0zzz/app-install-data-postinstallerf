OpenNL (Open Numerical Library) is a library for solving sparse linear systems,
especially designed for the Computer Graphics community. The goal for OpenNL is
to be as small as possible, while offering the subset of functionalities
required by this application field. The Makefiles of OpenNL can generate a
single .c + .h file, very easy to integrate in other projects. The distribution
includes an implementation of our Least Squares Conformal Maps parameterization
method.

New version OpenNL 3.2.1, includes support for CUDA and Fermi architecture
(Concurrent Number Cruncher and Nathan Bells ELL formats)

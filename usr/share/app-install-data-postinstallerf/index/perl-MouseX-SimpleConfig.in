Comment3='
This role loads simple configfiles to set object attributes. It is based on the
abstract role MouseXConfigFromFile, and uses ConfigAny to load your
configfile. ConfigAny will in turn support any of a variety of different
config formats, detected by the file extension. See ConfigAny for more
details about supported formats.

Like all MouseXConfigFromFile-derived configfile loaders, this module is
automatically supported by the MouseXGetopt role as well, which allows
specifying -configfile on the commandline.

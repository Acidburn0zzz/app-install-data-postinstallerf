The package offers font maps, and supporting material, that
make various Japanese fonts available to users of (u)ptex and
related programs or formats. The package does not ship any of
the fonts mentioned in the documention, but only map files for
dvipdfmx; the user must obtain the other fonts separately. The
first exception is that ipa and ipaex the respective fonts a
shipped as part of the TeX Live distribution and are available
for free. The other exception is that the Yu Mincho/Gothic
fonts are available to Windows and MacOSX users, as part of
their operating system distribution.

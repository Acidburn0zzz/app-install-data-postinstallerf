POEComponentLogger provides a simple logging component that uses
LogDispatchConfig to drive it, allowing you to log to multiple places at
once (e.g. to STDERR and Syslog at the same time) and also to flexibly define
your loggers output.

It is very simple to use, because it creates a Loggerlog method (yes, this
is namespace corruption, so shoot me). If you dont like this, feel free to
post directly to your logger as follows
  $kernel->post(logger, log, "An error occurred $!");

Comment3='
The ClassAccessorClassy Perl module provides an extremely small
footprint accessor/mutator declaration scheme for fast and convenient
object attribute setup.  It is intended as a simple and speedy mechanism
for preventing hash-key typos rather than a full-blown object system
with type checking and so on.

The accessor methods appear as a hidden parent class of your package
and generally try to stay out of the way.  The accessors and mutators
generated are of the form C<foo()> and C<set_foo()>, respectively.

Disposable Soft Synth Interface (DSSI, pronounced "dizzy") is a proposal for a
plugin API for software instruments (soft synths) with user interfaces,
permitting them to be hosted in-process by Linux audio applications. Think of
it as LADSPA-for-instruments, or something comparable to a simpler version of
VSTi.

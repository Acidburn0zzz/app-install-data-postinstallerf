The package provides classicists with some of the tools that
are needed for typesetting scholarly publications dealing with
Greek and Latin texts, with special emphasis on Greek verse. As
the packages name suggests, its core is a comprehensive set of
commands for generating metrical schemes and for placing
prosodical marks on text set in the Latin or the Greek
alphabet. The rest of the package provides a miscellany of
commands for symbols (most of them not directly related to
metre) that are often used in critical editions of classical
texts. The package does not require any special font all

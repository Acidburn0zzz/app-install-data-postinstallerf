Comment3='
There are a number of different modules and systems that constrain image
sizes, such as thumbnailing. Every one of these independantly implement the
same logic. That is, given a width and/or height constraint, they check to
see if the image is bigger than the constraint, and if so scale the image
down proportionally so that it fits within the constraints.

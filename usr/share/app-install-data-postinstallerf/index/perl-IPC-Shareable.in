Comment3='
IPCShareable allows you to tie a variable to shared memory making it
easy to share the contents of that variable with other Perl processes.
Scalars, arrays, and hashes can be tied.  The variable being tied may
contain arbitrarily complex data structures - including references to
arrays, hashes of hashes, etc.

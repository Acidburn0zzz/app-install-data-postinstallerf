MoreUnit is an Eclipse plugin that should assist with writing more unit tests.
It can decorate classes which have testcase(s) and mark methods in the editor
which are under test.  Renaming/moving classes/methods will cause moreUnit to
rename/move the corresponding test code.  Generation of test method stubs is
also possible.

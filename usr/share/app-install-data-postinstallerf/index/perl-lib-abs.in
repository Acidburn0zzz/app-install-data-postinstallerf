Comment3='
The main reason of this library is to transform relative paths to absolute
at the BEGIN stage, and push transformed to @INC. Relative path basis is
not the current working directory, but the location of file, where the
statement is (caller file). When using common lib, relative paths stays
relative to current working directory.

Shapely is a package for creation, manipulation, and analysis
of planar geometry objects ? designed especially for developers
of cutting edge geographic information systems. In a nutshell
Shapely lets you do PostGIS-ish stuff outside the context of a
database using idiomatic Python.

You can use this package with python-matplotlib and numpy.

Brewtarget is an open source beer recipe creation tool. It automatically
calculates color, bitterness, and other parameters for you while you drag and
drop ingredients into the recipe. Brewtarget also has many other tools such as
priming sugar calculators, OG correction help, and a unique mash designing tool.
It also can export and import recipes in BeerXML.

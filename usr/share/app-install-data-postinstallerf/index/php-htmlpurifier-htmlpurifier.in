Comment3='
Standards-compliant HTML filter library written in
PHP. HTML Purifier will not only remove all malicious code
(better known as XSS) with a thoroughly audited, secure yet permissive
white list, it will also make sure your documents are standards compliant,
something only achievable with a comprehensive knowledge of W3Cs
specifications.

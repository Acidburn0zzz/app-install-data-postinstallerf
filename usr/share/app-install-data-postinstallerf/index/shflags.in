Shell Flags (shFlags) is a library written to greatly simplify the handling of
command-line flags in Bourne based Unix shell scripts (bash, dash, ksh, sh, zsh)
on many Unix OSes (Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, etc.).

Most shell scripts use getopt for flags processing, but the different versions
of getopt on various OSes make writing portable shell scripts difficult. shFlags
instead provides an API that doesnt change across shell and OS versions so the
script writer can be confident that the script will work.
shFlags is a port of the google-gflags C++/Python library.

Vavoom is an enhanced open-source port of Doom. Allowing you to play not only
the classic 3D first-person shooter Doom, but also the Doom derived classics
Heretic, Hexen and Strife. Compared to the original games it adds extra
features such as translucency and freelook support and ofcourse the capability
to play these classics under Linux.

zita-rev1 is a reworked version of the reverb originally developed for Aeolus.
Its character is more hall than plate, but it can be used on a wide
variety of instruments or voices.
It is not a spatialiser - the early reflections are different for the L and R
inputs, but do not correspond to any real room. They have been tuned to match
left and right sources to some extent.

In Stereo mode a dry/wet mix control is provided, so it can be used either as
an insert or in send/return mode. For mono just connect one of the two
channels.

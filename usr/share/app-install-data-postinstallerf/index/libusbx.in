This package provides a way for applications to access USB devices.

Libusbx is a fork of the original libusb, which is a fully API and ABI
compatible drop in for the libusb-1.0.9 release. The libusbx fork was
started by most of the libusb-1.0 developers, after the original libusb
project did not produce a new release for over 18 months.
Note that this library is not compatible with the original libusb-0.1 series,
if you need libusb-0.1 compatibility install the libusb package.

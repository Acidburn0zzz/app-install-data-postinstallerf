Comment3='
Mined is the first text editor that provided Unicode support in a plain-text
terminal. It now has both extensive Unicode and CJK support offering
many specific features and covering special cases that other editors
are not aware of (like auto-detection features and automatic handling of
terminal variations or Han character information). Basically, it is an
editor tailored to efficient editing of plain text documents and
programs with features and interactive behavior designed for this
purpose.

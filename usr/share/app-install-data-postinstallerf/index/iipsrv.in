Comment3='
Light-weight streaming client-server system for the web-based viewing and
zooming of ultra high-resolution images. It is designed to be bandwidth
and memory efficient and usable even over a slow internet connection.

The system can handle both 8 and 16 bit images, CIELAB colorimetric images and
scientific imagery such as multispectral images. The fast streaming is
tile-based meaning the client only needs to download the portion of the whole
image that is visible on the screen of the user at their current viewing
resolution and not the entire image.
This makes it possible to view, navigate and zoom in real-time around

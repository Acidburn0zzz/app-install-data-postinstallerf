The floatrow package provides many ways to customize layouts of
floating environments and has code to cooperate with the
caption 3.x package. The package offers mechanisms to put
floats side by side, and to put the caption beside its float.
The floatrow settings could be expanded to the floats created
by packages rotating, wrapfig, subfig (in the case of rows of
subfloats), and longtable.

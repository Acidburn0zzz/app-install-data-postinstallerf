Comment3='
This is a tool that can discover data to be added to the end of a file to
produce a desired hexadecimal hash fragment.  It searches a message space and
runs a hashing algorithm against the original data plus the appended data to
determine if the desired hash fragment is present.  vanityhash can run
multiple parallel workers to effectively make use of multiple processors/cores/
threads, and supports multiple hash digest types (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, etc).

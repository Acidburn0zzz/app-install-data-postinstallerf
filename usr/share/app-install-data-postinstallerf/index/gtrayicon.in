Gtrayicon is a generic tray icon for GNOME. It defines two actions activate
and deactivate, that are alternated by clicking in the tray icon. You choose
what commands to run on each action. You can also define each actions icon and
a custom menu that is shown on left click. A sample menu file is included with
the package. Check /usr/share/doc/gtrayicon-1.1/sample.menu for more info.

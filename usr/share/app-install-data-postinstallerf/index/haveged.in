A Linux entropy source using the HAVEGE algorithm

Haveged is a user space entropy daemon which is not dependent upon the
standard mechanisms for harvesting randomness for the system entropy
pool. This is important in systems with high entropy needs or limited
user interaction (e.g. headless servers).
Haveged uses HAVEGE (HArdware Volatile Entropy Gathering and Expansion)
to maintain a 1M pool of random bytes used to fill /dev/random
whenever the supply of random bits in /dev/random falls below the low

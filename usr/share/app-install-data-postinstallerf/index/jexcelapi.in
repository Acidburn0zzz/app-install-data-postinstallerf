Jexcelapi allows Java developers to read Excel spreadsheets and generate Excel
spreadsheets dynamically. In addition, it contains a mechanism which allows
Java applications to read a spreadsheet, modify some cells and write the
modified spreadsheet.

Thanks to jexcelapi non Windows operating systems can run pure Java applications
which process and deliver Excel spreadsheets. Because it is Java, this API may
be invoked from within a servlet, thus giving access to Excel functionality
over internet and intranet web applications.

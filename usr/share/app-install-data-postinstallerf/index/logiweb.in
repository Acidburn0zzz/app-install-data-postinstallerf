Logiweb allows to web publish Logiweb pages, i.e.
journal quality articles which contain machine readable objects
like  programs, testsuites, definitions, axioms, lemmas, and
proofs. Among other, Logiweb is suited for literate programming,
for publication of machine verified proofs, and for writing
proof checkers. Logiweb allows Logiweb pages to reference
previously published Logiweb pages such that programs on a page
may call programs on referenced pages, proofs on a page may
reference lemmas on referenced pages, and so on.

The package provides a LaTeX interface to the micro-typographic
extensions that were introduced by pdfTeX and have since also
propagated to XeTeX and LuaTeX most prominently, character
protrusion and font expansion, furthermore the adjustment of
interword spacing and additional kerning, as well as
hyphenatable letterspacing (tracking) and the possibility to
disable all or selected ligatures. These features may be
applied to customisable sets of fonts, and all micro-
typographic aspects of the fonts can be configured in a
straight-forward and flexible way. Settings for various fonts

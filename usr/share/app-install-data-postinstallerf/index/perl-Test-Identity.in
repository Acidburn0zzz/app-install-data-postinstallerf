Comment3='
This module provides a single testing function, identical. It asserts that
a given reference is as expected; that is, it either refers to the same
object or is undef. It is similar to TestMoreis except that it uses
refaddr, ensuring that it behaves correctly even if the references under
test are objects that overload stringification or numification.

The package defines an \excludeonly command, which is (in
effect) the opposite of \includeonly. If both \includeonly and
\excludeonly exist in a document, only files "allowed" by both
will be included. The package redefines the internal \@include
command, so it conflicts with packages that do the same.
Examples are the classes paper.cls and thesis.cls.

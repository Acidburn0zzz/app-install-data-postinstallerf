GMediaServer is a UPnP compatible media server for the GNU system. It is part
of the GNU project.

GMediaServer serves audio and video files to certain network connected media
players. Most hardware media players only play music and/or video - they dont
provide the media themselves. Those media files have to come from a device on
the network.

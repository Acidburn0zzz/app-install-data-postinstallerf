Comment3='
cpan-upload is a script which automates the process of uploading a file to
CPAN using PAUSE, the Perl Authors Upload Server.  For example, to upload a
recent version of the NetDict module I ran

    % cpan-upload -verbose Net-Dict-1.07.tar.gz
If everything went OK, you?ll get two mail messages from the PAUSE monitor
one to acknowledge the upload, and one to let you know if your upload made
it through to CPAN.

KScope is a QT4 front-end to Cscope. It provides a source-editing
environment for large C projects, such as the Linux kernel.

KScope is by no means intended to be a replacement to any of the leading
Linux/KDE IDEs, such as KDevelop. First of all, it is not an Integrated
Development Environment it does not provide the usual write/compile/debug
cycle supported by most IDEs. Instead, KScope is focused on source
editing and analysis.

eFTE is an advanced programmers editor with goals of being lightweight, yet
totally configurable. Support for user defined programming languages, menu
systems and key bindings are provided with many common defaults already
defined. eFTE is still a new project, however, we extend from the FTE editor
which was first released in 1995, so eFTE is tried and true with many features
for the programmer/text editor.

This package contains common datafiles for efte.

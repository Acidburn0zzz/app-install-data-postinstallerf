Comment3='
These are files that are shared between the applications of the freemedforms
suite, such as freemedforms, freediams, freeaccount, freeicd, freepad,
freetoolbox.

All applications of the suite should require this package when they are
packaged for Fedora instead of re-generating these files. See the freediams
package for hints on how to do this.

Txfonts supplies virtual text roman fonts using Adobe Times (or
URW NimbusRomNo9L) with some modified and additional text
symbols in the OT1, T1, and TS1 encodings; maths alphabets
using Times/URW Nimbus; maths fonts providing all the symbols
of the Computer Modern and AMS fonts, including all the Greek
capital letters from CMR; and additional maths fonts of various
other symbols. The set is complemented by a sans-serif set of
text fonts, based on Helvetica/NimbusSanL, and a monospace set.
All the fonts are in Type 1 format (AFM and PFB files), and are
supported by TeX metrics (VF and TFM files) and macros for use

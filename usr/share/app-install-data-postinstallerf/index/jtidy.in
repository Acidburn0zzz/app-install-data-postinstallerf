JTidy is a Java port of HTML Tidy, a HTML syntax checker and pretty
printer.  Like its non-Java cousin, JTidy can be used as a tool for
cleaning up malformed and faulty HTML.  In addition, JTidy provides a
DOM interface to the document that is being processed, which
effectively makes you able to use JTidy as a DOM parser for real-world
HTML.

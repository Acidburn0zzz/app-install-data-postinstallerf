Balsa is a GNOME email client which supports mbox, maildir, and mh
local mailboxes, and IMAP4 and POP3 remote mailboxes. Email can be
sent via sendmail or SMTP. Optional multithreading support allows for
non-intrusive retrieval and sending of mail. A finished GUI similar to
that of the Eudora email client supports viewing images inline, saving
message parts, viewing headers, adding attachments, moving messages,
and printing messages.

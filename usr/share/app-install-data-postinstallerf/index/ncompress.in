The ncompress package contains the compress and uncompress file
compression and decompression utilities, which are compatible with the
original UNIX compress utility (.Z file extensions).  These utilities
cant handle gzipped (.gz file extensions) files, but gzip can handle
compressed files.

Install ncompress if you need compression/decompression utilities
which are compatible with the original UNIX compress utility.

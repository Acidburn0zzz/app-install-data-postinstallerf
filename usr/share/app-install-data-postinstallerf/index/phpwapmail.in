phpWAPmail is a WAP-based e-mail client. It is intended for providing access
to e-mail servers from cellular phones using WAP browser.

phpWAPmail is written in PHP and uses standard PHP imap module to operate
with mailboxes. It is placed on a web-server and acts as a proxy between
cellular users and mail servers. This way it can provide faster access
to the mailboxes rather than built-in e-mail clients and less network traffic.
Edit /etc/httpd/conf.d/phpwapmail.conf to allow access
by remote IP addresses. Edit /etc/phpwapmail/config.php

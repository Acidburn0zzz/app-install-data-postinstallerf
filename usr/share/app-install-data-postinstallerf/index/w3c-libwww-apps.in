Web applications built using Libwww Robot, Command line tool,
line mode browser.  The Robot can crawl web sites faster, and
with lower load, than any other web walker that we know of,
due to its extensive pipelining and use of HTTP/1.1.
The command line tool (w3c) is very useful for manipulation of
Web sites that implement more than just HTTP GET (e.g. PUT,
 POST, etc.).

OpenStack Object Storage (Swift) aggregates commodity servers to work together
in clusters for reliable, redundant, and large-scale storage of static objects.
Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with the
OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and integrity
across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by adding new nodes,
which are automatically configured. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to
replicate its content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software
logic to ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
expensive equipment.

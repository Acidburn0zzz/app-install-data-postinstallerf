Comment3='
This library provides functions to throw and catch exceptions.
Unlike the functions from Control.Exception, which work in IO,
these work in any stack of monad transformers (from the transformers package)
with IO as the base monad. You can extend this functionality to other monads,
by creating an instance of the MonadCatchIO class.

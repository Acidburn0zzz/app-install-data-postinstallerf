Node-CType is a way to read and write binary data in a structured and easy to
use format. Its name comes from the C header file.

There are two APIs that you can use, depending on what abstraction youd like.
The low level API lets you read and write individual integers and floats from
buffers. The higher level API lets you read and write structures of these.

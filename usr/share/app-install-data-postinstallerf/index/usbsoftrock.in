Comment3='
Simple program which accepts convenient command line options
(e.g., frequencies in MHz), speaks the DG8SAQ USB protocol, understands
the Si570. It supports advanced firmware (that allows calculation of the
registers) and features such as BPF selection and smooth tuning in Fred
PE0FKOs firmware.

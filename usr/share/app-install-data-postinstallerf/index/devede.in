DeVeDe is a program to create video DVDs and CDs (VCD, sVCD or CVD)
suitable for home players, from any number of video files, in any
of the formats supported by Mplayer. The big advantage over other
utilities is that it only needs Mplayer, Mencoder, DVDAuthor, VCDImager
and MKisofs (well, and Python 2.4, PyGTK and PyGlade), so its
dependencies are really small.

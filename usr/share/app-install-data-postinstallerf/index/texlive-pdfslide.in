Comment3='
This is a package for use with pdftex, to make nice
presentation slides. Its aims are to devise a method for
easier technical presentation; to help the mix of mathematical
formulae with text and graphics which the present day wysiwyg
tools fail to accomplish; to exploit the platform independence
of TeX so that presentation documents become portable; and to
offer the freedom and possibilities of using various
backgrounds and other embellishments that a user can imagine to
have in as presentation. The package can make use of the
facilities of the PPower4 post-processor.

This module greatly simplifies common author tests for modules heading towards
CPAN. I was sick of copy/pasting the tons of t/foo.t scripts + managing them
in every distribution. I thought it would be nice to bundle all of it into one
module and toss it on CPAN ) That way, every time I update this module all of
my distributions would be magically updated!

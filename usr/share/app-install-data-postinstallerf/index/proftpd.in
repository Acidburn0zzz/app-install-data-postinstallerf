ProFTPD is an enhanced FTP server with a focus toward simplicity, security,
and ease of configuration. It features a very Apache-like configuration
syntax, and a highly customizable server infrastructure, including support for
multiple virtual FTP servers, anonymous FTP, and permission-based directory
visibility.

This package defaults to the standalone behavior of ProFTPD, but all the
needed scripts to have it run by xinetd instead are included.

Hive files are the undocumented binary files that Windows uses to
store the Windows Registry on disk.  Hivex is a library that can read
and write to these files.

hivexsh is a shell you can use to interactively navigate a hive
binary file.
hivexregedit lets you export and merge to the textual regedit
format.

The Remote Input server allows clients to send input events, such as
mouse movements or keyboard presses, over a secure, authenticated
communication channel. Remote devices, be they separate computers
or mobile devices, can provide mouse, keyboard, multi-touch,
switches and other input to the Remote Input server, and the server
will create virtual keyboards and mice for each connection.

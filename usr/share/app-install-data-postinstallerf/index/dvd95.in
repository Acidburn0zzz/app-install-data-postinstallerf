DVD95 is a GNOME application to convert DVD9 (8.5G) to DVD5 (4.7G).

It needs no additional packages, an onboard version of vamps and dvdauthor
is used, to be as fast as possible. Interface is pretty simple yo use.
Shrinking factor may be computed for best results, or an adaptive
compression ratio method may be used.
Dvd can be converted to a file tree or an ISO file. The result can be played
with xine, vlc, or mplayer or burned using third party software (k3b).

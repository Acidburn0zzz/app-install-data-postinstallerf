LIRC is a package that allows you to decode and send infra-red and
other signals of many (but not all) commonly used remote controls.
Included applications include daemons which decode the received
signals as well as user space applications which allow controlling a
computer with a remote control.  This package includes files for
developing applications that use LIRC.

Comment3='
libdmtx is open source software for reading and writing Data Matrix 2D
bar-codes on Linux, Unix, OS X, Windows, and mobile devices. At its core
libdmtx is a shared library, allowing C/C++ programs to use its capabilities
without restrictions or overhead.

The included utility programs, dmtxread and dmtxwrite, provide the official
interface to libdmtx from the command line, and also serve as a good reference
for programmers who wish to write their own programs that interact with
libdmtx. All of the software in the libdmtx package is distributed under
the LGPLv2 and can be used freely under these terms.

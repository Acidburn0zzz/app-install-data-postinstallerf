EGD is an Entropy Gathering Daemon meant to be used on systems that can run GPG
but which dont have a convenient (or reliable) source of random bits. It is a
regular user-space program that sits around, running programs like w and
last and vmstat, collecting the randomness (or at least the
unpredictability) inherent in the output of these system statistics programs
when used on a reasonably busy system. It slowly stirs the output of these
gathering programs into a pool of entropy, much like the linux kernel device,
and allows other programs to read out random bits from this pool.

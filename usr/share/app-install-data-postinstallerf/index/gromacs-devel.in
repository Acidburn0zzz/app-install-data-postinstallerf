GROMACS is a versatile and extremely well optimized package to perform
molecular dynamics computer simulations and subsequent trajectory analysis.
It is developed for biomolecules like proteins, but the extremely high
performance means it is used also in several other field like polymer chemistry
and solid state physics.

This package contains header files and development libraries for the GROMACS
molecular dynamics software. You need it if you want to write your own analysis
programs.

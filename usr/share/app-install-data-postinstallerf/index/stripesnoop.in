Stripe Snoop is a suite of research tools that captures, modifies, validates,
generates, analyzes, and shares data from magstripe cards. Numerous readers
are supported to gather this information. In addition to simply displaying
the raw characters that are encoded on the card, Stripe Snoop has a database
of known card formats. It uses this to give you more detailed information
about the card.

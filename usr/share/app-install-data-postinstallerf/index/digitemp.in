DigiTemp is a simple to use console application for reading values from
Dallas Semiconductor 1-wire devices. Its main use is for reading temperature
sensors, but it also reads counters and understands the 1-wire hubs with
devices on different branches of the network. DigiTemp now supports the
following 1-wire temperature sensors DS18S20 (and DS1820), DS18B20, DS1822,
the DS2438 Smart Battery Monitor, DS2422 and DS2423 Counters, DS2409
MicroLAN Coupler (used in 1-wire hubs) and the AAG TAI-8540 humidity sensor.

Memtest86+ is a thorough stand-alone memory test for x86 and x86-64
architecture computers. BIOS based memory tests are only a quick
check and often miss many of the failures that are detected by
Memtest86+.

The ELF version should be used for booting from grub,
and avoids the following errors
"Error 7 Loading below 1MB is not supported"
"Error 13 Invalid or unsupported executable format"
"Error 28 Selected item cannot fit into memory"

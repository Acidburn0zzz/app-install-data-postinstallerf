MegaGlest is an open source 3D-real-time strategy game, where you control
the armies of one of seven different factions Tech, Magic, Egyptians,
Indians, Norsemen, Persian or Romans. The game is setup in one of 16
naturally looking settings, which -like the unit models- are crafted with
great appreciation for detail. Additional game data can be downloaded from
within the game at no cost.

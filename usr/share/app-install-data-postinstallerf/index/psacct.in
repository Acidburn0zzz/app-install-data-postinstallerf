The psacct package contains several utilities for monitoring process
activities, including ac, lastcomm, accton and sa. The ac command
displays statistics about how long users have been logged on. The
lastcomm command displays information about previous executed
commands. The accton command turns process accounting on or off. The
sa command summarizes information about previously executed
commands.

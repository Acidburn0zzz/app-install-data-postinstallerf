hostapd is a user space daemon for access point and authentication servers. It
implements IEEE 802.11 access point management, IEEE 802.1X/WPA/WPA2/EAP
Authenticators and RADIUS authentication server.

hostapd is designed to be a "daemon" program that runs in the back-ground and
acts as the backend component controlling authentication. hostapd supports
separate frontend programs and an example text-based frontend, hostapd_cli, is
included with hostapd.

Even in the age of OOP one must develop algorithms. Nassi-
Shneiderman diagrams are a well known tool to describe an
algorithm in a graphical way. The package offers some macros
for generating those diagrams in a LaTeX document. The package
provides the most important elements of a Nassi-Shneiderman
diagram, including processing blocks, loops, mapping
conventions for alternatives, etc. Diagrams are drawn using the
picture environment (using pict2e for preference).

Amara is a collection of Pythonic tools for XML data binding. Not just tools
that happen to be written in Python, but tools built from the ground up to use
Python idioms and take advantage of the many advantages of Python over other
programming languages.

Amara builds on 4Suite, but whereas 4Suite focuses more on literal
implementation of XML standards in Python, Amara adds a much more Pythonic face
to these capabilities.

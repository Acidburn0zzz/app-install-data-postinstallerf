Quarry is a multi-purpose GUI for several board games, at present Go, Amazons
and Reversi. It allows users to play against computer players (third-party
programs, e.g. GNU Go or GRhino) or other humans, view and edit game records.
Future versions will also support Internet game servers and provide certain
features for developers of board game-playing engines for enhancing their
programs.

This package (built using the facilities of catchfile) provides
a macro \catchfilebetweentags acts like the original \catchfile
but only extracts a portion of the file instead of the complete
file. The extracted portion can be delimited by strings or by
docstrip tags %<*tag> .... %</tag> (comments in the caught
region may be included or dropped).

The blist is a drop-in replacement for the Python list that provides
better performance when modifying large lists. The blist package also
provides sortedlist, sortedset, weaksortedlist, weaksortedset,
sorteddict, and btuple types.

Pythons built-in list is a dynamically-sized array; to insert or
remove an item from the beginning or middle of the list, it has to
move most of the list in memory, i.e., O(n) operations. The blist uses
a flexible, hybrid array/tree structure and only needs to move a small
portion of items in memory, specifically using O(log n) operations.

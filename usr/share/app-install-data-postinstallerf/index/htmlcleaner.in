HtmlCleaner is open-source HTML parser written in Java. HTML found on Web is
usually dirty, ill-formed and unsuitable for further processing.
For any serious consumption of such documents, it is necessary to first
clean up the mess and bring the order to tags, attributes and ordinary text.
For the given HTML document, HtmlCleaner reorders individual elements and
produces well-formed XML. By default, it follows similar rules that the most
of web browsers use in order to create Document Object Model. However, user
may provide custom tag and rule set for tag filtering and balancing.

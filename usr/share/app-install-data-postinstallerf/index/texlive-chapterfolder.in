Comment3='
This package simplifies working with folder structures that
match the chapter/section/subsection structure. It provides
macros to define a folder that contains the file for a
chapter/section/subsection, and provides macros that allow
inclusion without using the full path, rather the path relative
to the current folder of the chapter/section/subsection. It
makes easy changing the name of a folder, for example.

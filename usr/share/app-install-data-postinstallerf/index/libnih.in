libnih is a small library for C application development containing functions
that, despite its name, are not implemented elsewhere in the standard library
set.

libnih is roughly equivalent to other C libraries such as glib, except that its
focus is on a small size and intended for applications that sit very low in the
software stack, especially outside of /usr.

Smart comments provide an easy way to insert debugging and tracking code into
a program. They can report the value of a variable, track the progress of a
loop, and verify that particular assertions are true.

Best of all, when youre finished debugging, you dont have to remove them.
Simply commenting out the use SmartComments line turns them back into
regular comments. Leaving smart comments in your code is smart because if you
needed them once, youll almost certainly need them again later.

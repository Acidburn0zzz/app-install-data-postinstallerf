Monsterz is a little arcade puzzle game, similar to the famous Bejeweled or
Zookeeper. The goal of the game is to create rows of similar monsters, either
horizontally or vertically. The only allowed move is the swap of two adjacent
monsters, on the condition that it creates a row of three or more. When
alignments are cleared, pieces fall from the top of the screen to fill the
board again. Chain reactions earn you even more points.

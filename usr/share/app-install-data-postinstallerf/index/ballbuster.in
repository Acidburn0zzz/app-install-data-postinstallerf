Game inspired by one of the great classics. The purpose of the game is to
remove all the bricks on the screen, by hitting them with a ball. You can
control the ball by bouncing it back at the bricks with a paddle which you
control with your mouse. The game features A built in level editor, 20 power
ups and special effects (particle, alpha, rotating, and zooming).

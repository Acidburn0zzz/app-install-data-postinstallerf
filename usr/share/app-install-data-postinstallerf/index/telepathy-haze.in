Comment3='
telepathy-haze is a connection manager built around libpurple, the core of
Pidgin (formerly Gaim), as a Summer of Code project under the Pidgin umbrella.
Ultimately, any protocol supported by libpurple will be supported by
telepathy-haze; for now, XMPP, MSN and AIM are known to work acceptably, and
others will probably work too.

Perltidy is a Perl script which indents and reformats Perl scripts to
make them easier to read. If you write Perl scripts, or spend much
time reading them, you will probably find it useful.  The formatting
can be controlled with command line parameters.  The default parameter
settings approximately follow the suggestions in the Perl Style Guide.
Perltidy can also output HTML of both POD and source code.  Besides
reformatting scripts, Perltidy can be a great help in tracking down
errors with missing or extra braces, parentheses, and square brackets
because it is very good at localizing errors.

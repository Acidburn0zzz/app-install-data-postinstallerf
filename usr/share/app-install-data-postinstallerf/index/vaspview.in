This is a scientific visualization package for examining output files
generated by the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package, a package for
performing ab-initio quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics using
pseudopotentials and a plane wave basis set. The project was initiated
when a chemical engineering professor requested assitance in visualizing
output files produced by the above package. It displays iso-surfaces and
slices of a three-dimensional data set, along with the atoms that make
up the molecule the calculations were performed for, and allows symbolic
bonds to be inserted between them.

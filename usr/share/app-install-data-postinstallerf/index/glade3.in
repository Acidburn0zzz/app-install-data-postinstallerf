Comment3='
Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick and easy development of user interfaces for
the GTK+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment.

The user interfaces designed in Glade are saved as XML, which can be used in
numerous programming languages including C, C++, Java, Perl, Python, C#, Pike,
Ruby, Haskell, Objective Caml and Scheme. Adding support for other languages
is easy too.
The glade3 package contains a version of Glade for GTK+ 2.x. For GTK+ 3.x
support, use the glade package instead.

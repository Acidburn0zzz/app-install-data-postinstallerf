The Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit (MRPT) is an extensive, cross-platform,
and open source C++ library aimed to help robotics researchers to design and
implement algorithms in the fields of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM), computer vision, and motion planning (obstacle avoidance).

This package provides the headers and required files to build third-party
applications that use MRPT libraries.

Comment3='
repoze.who is an identification and authentication framework for arbitrary WSGI
applications.  It acts as WSGI middleware.

repoze.who is inspired by Zope 2s Pluggable Authentication Service (PAS) (but
repoze.who is not dependent on Zope in any way; it is useful for any WSGI
application).  It provides no facility for authorization (ensuring whether a
user can or cannot perform the operation implied by the request).  This is
considered to be the domain of the WSGI application.

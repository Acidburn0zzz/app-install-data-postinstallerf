The SHOGUN machine learning toolboxs focus is on large scale kernel methods
and especially on Support Vector Machines (SVM).  It provides a generic SVM
object interfacing to several different SVM implementations, among them the
state of the art LibSVM.  Each of the SVMs can be combined with a variety of
kernels.  The toolbox not only provides efficient implementations of the most
common kernels, like the Linear, Polynomial, Gaussian and Sigmoid Kernel but
also comes with a number of recent string kernels as e.g. the Locality
Improved, Fischer, TOP, Spectrum, Weighted Degree Kernel (with shifts).  For
the latter the efficient LINADD optimizations are implemented.  Also SHOGUN

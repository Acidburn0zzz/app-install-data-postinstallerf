Comment3='
NetIPCMatch is based upon, and does the same thing as NetIPMatch. The
unconditionally exported subroutine match_ip determines if the IP to match
(first argument) matches any of the subsequent IP arguments. Match arguments
may be absolute quads, as 127.0.0.1, or contain mask bits as
111.245.76.248/29. A true return value indicates a match. It was written in
C, rather than a macro, preprocessed through perls source filter mechanism
(as is NetIPMatch), so that the IP arguments could be traditional perl
scalars. The C code is lean and mean (IMHO).

Muse is an authoring and publishing environment for (X)Emacs. It
simplifies the process of writings documents and publishing them to
various output formats. Muse uses a very simple Wiki-like format as
input.  Muse consists of two main parts an enhanced text-mode for
authoring documents and navigating within Muse projects, and a set of
publishing styles for generating different kinds of output.

This package contains the files common to both the Emacs and XEmacs
installations of Muse. You need to install either (or both) of
emacs-muse and xemacs-muse to use Muse.

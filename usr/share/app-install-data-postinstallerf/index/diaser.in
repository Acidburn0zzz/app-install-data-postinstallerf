An advanced disk based backup volume accumulator, replication and management
system for HE and SME. A quick and low-cost way to make an environment more
robust and data more accessible by archiving in multiple places. This
replication also provides fast retrieval of archived data from all node
hosting locations. A Perl installer creates the system. Nodes can be dedicated
to storage or used for existing services over unused bandwidth. DIASER works
in user space over SSH. The software is based on DIAP/LTASP which is a storage
architecture designed to structure months to years of long term sustainable
archiving space including retrospective archiving.

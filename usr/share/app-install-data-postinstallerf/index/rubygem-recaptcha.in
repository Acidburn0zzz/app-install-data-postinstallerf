This plug-in adds helpers for the reCAPTCHA API.
In your views you can use the recaptcha_tags method
to embed the needed JavaScript, and you can validate
in your controllers with verify_recaptcha.

Beforehand you need to configure Recaptcha with your
custom private and public key. You may find detailed
examples below.
Exceptions will be raised if you call these methods
and the keys can?t be found.

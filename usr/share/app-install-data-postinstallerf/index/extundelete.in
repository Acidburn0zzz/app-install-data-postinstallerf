Comment3='
extundelete is a utility that can recover deleted files from an ext3 or ext4
partition. extundelete uses the information stored in the partitions journal
to attempt to recover a file that has been deleted from the partition. There is
no guarantee that any particular file will be able to be undeleted, so always
try to have a good backup system in place, or at least put one in place after
recovering your files!

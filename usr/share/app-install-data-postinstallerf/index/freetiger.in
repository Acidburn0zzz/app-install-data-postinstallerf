Comment3='
freetiger is an implementation of the tiger hash algorithm made looking
only at the tiger reference paper (thus ignoring the reference code until
a working implementation was made). It also includes a modified version
of the main program included with the tiger reference implementation which
was used for benchmarking purposes.

It has been optimized for usage in the TTH calculation algorithm and
includes optimized versions that will calculate the hashes for the
1024 byte file chunks and the 48 byte hash concatenation appending the
proper suffix automatically thus minimizing memory to memory copying.

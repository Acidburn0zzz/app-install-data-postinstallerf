Motion is a software motion detector. It grabs images from video4linux devices
and/or from webcams (such as the axis network cameras). Motion is the perfect
tool for keeping an eye on your property keeping only those images that are
interesting. Motion is strictly command line driven and can run as a daemon
with a rather small footprint. This version is built with ffmpeg support but
without MySQL and PostgreSQL support.

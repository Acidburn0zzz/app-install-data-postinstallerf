The Python programming languages interpreter can be extended with
dynamically loaded extensions and can be embedded in other programs.
This package contains the header files and libraries needed to do
these types of tasks.

Install python-devel if you want to develop Python extensions.  The
python package will also need to be installed.  Youll probably also
want to install the python-docs package, which contains Python
documentation.

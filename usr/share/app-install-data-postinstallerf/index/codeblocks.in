CodeBlocks is a free C++ IDE built specifically to meet the most demanding
needs of its users. It was designed, right from the start, to be extensible
and configurable. Built around a plug-in framework, CodeBlocks can be
extended with plug-in DLLs. It includes a plugin wizard, so you can compile
your own plug-ins.

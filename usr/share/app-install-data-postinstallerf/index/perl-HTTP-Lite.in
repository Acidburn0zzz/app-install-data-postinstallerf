Comment3='
HTTPLite is a stand-alone lightweight HTTP/1.1 implementation for perl. It is
not intended as a replacement for the fully-features LWP module. Instead, it is
intended for use in situations where it is desirable to install the minimal
number of modules to achieve HTTP support, or where LWP is not a good candidate
due to CPU overhead, such as slower processors. HTTPLite is also
significantly faster than LWP.

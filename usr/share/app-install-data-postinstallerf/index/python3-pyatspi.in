Comment3='
at-spi allows assistive technologies to access GTK-based
applications. Essentially it exposes the internals of applications for
automation, so tools such as screen readers, magnifiers, or even
scripting interfaces can query and interact with GUI controls.

This package includes a python3 client library for at-spi.

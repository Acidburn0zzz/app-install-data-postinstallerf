The Cache modules are designed to assist a developer in persisting data
for a specified period of time. Often these modules are used in web
applications to store data locally to save repeated and redundant
expensive calls to remote machines or databases.

The Cache interface is implemented by derived classes that store cached
data in different manners (such as as files on a filesystem, or in memory).

This plugin allows you to take advantage of a rather simple, and usual,
authentication and authorization setup, in which the users? data, the groups
and the permissions used in the application are all stored in a SQLAlchemy
or Elixir-managed database.

Put simply, it configures repoze.who and repoze.what in one go so that you
can have an authentication and authorization system working quickly ? hence
the name.

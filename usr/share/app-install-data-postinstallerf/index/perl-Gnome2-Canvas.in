Comment3='
The Gnome Canvas is an engine for structured graphics
that offers a rich imaging model, high-performance
rendering, and a powerful, high level API.

It offers a choice of two rendering back-ends,
one based on GDK for extremely fast display, and
another based on Libart, a sophisticated, antialiased,
alpha-compositing engine. This widget can be used
for flexible display of graphics and for creating
interactive user interface elements.

Comment3='
SNMPTT (SNMP Trap Translator) is an SNMP trap handler written in Perl
for use with the Net-SNMP / UCD-SNMP snmptrapd program.  It can be
used to translate trap output from snmptrapd to more descriptive and
human friendly form, supports logging, invoking external programs, and
has the ability to accept or reject traps based on a number of
parameters.

The package provides a macro \sidenote, that places a note in
the margin of the document, with its baseline aligned with the
baseline in the body of the document. These sidenotes are
numbered (both in the text, and on the notes themselves). The
package loads the package etoolbox, pgfopts, marginnote and
perpage.

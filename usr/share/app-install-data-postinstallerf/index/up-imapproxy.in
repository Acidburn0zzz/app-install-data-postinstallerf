imapproxy was written to compensate for webmail clients that are
unable to maintain persistent connections to an IMAP server. Most
webmail clients need to log in to an IMAP server for nearly every
single transaction. This behaviour can cause tragic performance
problems on the IMAP server. imapproxy tries to deal with this problem
by leaving server connections open for a short time after a webmail
client logs out. When the webmail client connects again, imapproxy
will determine if theres a cached connection available and reuse it
if possible.

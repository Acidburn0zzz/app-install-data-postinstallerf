Unicornscan is an attempt at a user-land distributed TCP/IP stack. It is
intended to provide a researcher a superior interface for introducing a
stimulus into and measuring a response from a TCP/IP enabled device or
network. Although it currently has hundreds of individual features, a main
set of abilities include Asynchronous stateless TCP scanning with all
variations of TCP flags, asynchronous stateless TCP banner grabbing,
asynchronous protocol specific UDP scanning (sending enough of a signature
to elicit a response), active and passive remote OS, application and
component identification by analyzing responses, PCAP file logging and
filtering, relational database output, custom module support, customized

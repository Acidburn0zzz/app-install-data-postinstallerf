ConsoleKit contains some tools that require Xlib to be installed,
those are in this separate package so server systems need not install
X. Applications (such as xorg-x11-xinit) and login managers (such as
gdm) that need to register their X sessions with ConsoleKit needs to
have a Requires for this package.

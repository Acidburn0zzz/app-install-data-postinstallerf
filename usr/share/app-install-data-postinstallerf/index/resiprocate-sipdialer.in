sipdialer is a click-to-call application that uses the SIP REFER
method to force a SIP phone (for example, the phone on your desk)
to dial another number.  It can be registered in GConf to handle
clicks on sip, sips and tel URIs in other applications and the
web browser.
reSIProcate is a framework that aims to fully implement the SIP protocol
in first class C++.  It is intended for use in other applications,
such as the repro SIP proxy.

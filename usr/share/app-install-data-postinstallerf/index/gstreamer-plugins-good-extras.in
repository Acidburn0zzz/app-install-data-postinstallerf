GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters which
operate on media data.

GStreamer Good Plug-ins is a collection of well-supported plug-ins of
good quality and under the LGPL license.
This package (gstreamer-plugins-good-extras) contains extra "good" plugins
which are not used very much and require additional libraries to be installed.

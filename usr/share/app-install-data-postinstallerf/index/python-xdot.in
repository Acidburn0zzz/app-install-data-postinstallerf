xdot.py is an interactive viewer for graphs written in Graphvizs dot
language.

Internally it uses the graphvizs xdot output format as an intermediate
format, and PyGTK and Cairo for rendering.
xdot.py can be used either as a standalone application from command line
(as "xdot"), or as a library embedded in a python application.

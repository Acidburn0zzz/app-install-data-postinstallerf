scamper is a program that is able to conduct Internet measurement tasks to
large numbers of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, in parallel, to fill a specified
packets-per-second rate. Currently, it supports the well-known ping and
traceroute techniques, as well as radargun, ally, mercator, sting, and parts
of tbit.

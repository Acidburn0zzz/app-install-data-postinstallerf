RSIBreak is a small utility which bothers you at certain intervals. The
interval and duration of two different timers can be configured. You can
use the breaks to stretch out or do the dishes. The aim of this utility
is to let you know when it is time to have a break from your computer.
This can help people to prevent Repetive Strain Injury.

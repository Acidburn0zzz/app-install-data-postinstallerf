The package allows citations in the German style, which is
considered by many to be particularly reader-friendly. The
citation provides a small amount of bibliographic information
in a footnote on the page where each citation is made. It
combines a desire to eliminate unnecessary page-turning with
the look-up efficiency afforded by numeric citations. The
package makes use of the (still experimental) BibLaTeX package,
and is itself also considered experimental; comment is invited.

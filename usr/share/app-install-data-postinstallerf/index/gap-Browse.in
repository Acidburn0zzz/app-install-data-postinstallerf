Comment3='
The motivation for this package was to develop functions for an
interactive display of two-dimensional arrays of data, for example
character tables.  They should be displayed with labeled rows and
columns, the display should allow some markup for fonts or colors, it
should be possible to search for entries, to sort rows or columns, to
hide and unhide information, to bind commands to keys, and so on.

To achieve this our package now provides three levels of functionality,
where in particular the first level may also be used for completely
other types of applications

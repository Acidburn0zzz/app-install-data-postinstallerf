Gtatool is a command line tool to manipulate GTAs.

It provides a set of commands that manipulate GTAs on various levels
array element components, array dimensions, whole arrays, and streams of arrays.
For example, you can add components to array elements, merge separate arrays
into combined arrays in different ways, apply global transformations to array
data, reorder the array data, and much more.
Additionally, gtatool can import from and export to many other file formats, see
the sub-packages!

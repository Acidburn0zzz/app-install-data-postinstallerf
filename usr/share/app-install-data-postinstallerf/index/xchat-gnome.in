xchat-gnome is a new frontend for the popular X-Chat IRC client.  GNOMEs
philosophy in terms of user interfaces has been progressing towards
presenting the user with few options, yet sane defaults. While many of the
normal X-Chat options will be preserved inside GConf, only the most
common settings will be included in the main user interface. .

Ncrack is a high-speed network authentication cracking tool. It was
built to help companies secure their networks by proactively testing
all their hosts and networking devices for poor passwords. Security
professionals also rely on Ncrack when auditing their clients. Ncrack
was designed using a modular approach, a command-line syntax similar to
Nmap and a dynamic engine that can adapt its behaviour based on network
feedback. It allows for rapid, yet reliable large-scale auditing of
multiple hosts.

Comment3='
RNGOM is an open-source Java library for parsing RELAX NG grammars.

In particular, RNGOM can
* parse the XML syntax
* parse the compact syntax
* check all the semantic restrictions as specified in the specification
* parse RELAX NG into application-defined data structures
* build a default data structure based around the binarized simple syntax or
  another data structure that preserves more of the parsed information
* parse foreign elements/attributes in a schema

Simon is an open-source speech recognition program and replaces the mouse
and keyboard.  It is designed to be very flexible and allows customization
for any application where speech recognition is needed.  It is in development
for physically disabled people and seniors to give them the possibility to
chat, to write e-mails, to surf the internet, to do internet-banking and much
more.

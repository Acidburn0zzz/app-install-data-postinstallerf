Comment3='
The nfs-utils package provides a daemon for the kernel NFS server and
related tools, which provides a much higher level of performance than the
traditional Linux NFS server used by most users.

This package also contains the showmount program.  Showmount queries the
mount daemon on a remote host for information about the NFS (Network File
System) server on the remote host.  For example, showmount can display the
clients which are mounted on that host.
This package also contains the mount.nfs and umount.nfs program.

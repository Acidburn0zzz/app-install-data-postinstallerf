This package contains the MAKEDEV program, which makes it easier to create
and maintain the files in the /dev directory.  /dev directory files
correspond to a particular device supported by Linux (serial or printer
ports, scanners, sound cards, tape drives, CD-ROM drives, hard drives,
etc.) and interface with the drivers in the kernel.

You should install the MAKEDEV package because the MAKEDEV utility makes
it easy to manage the /dev directory device files.

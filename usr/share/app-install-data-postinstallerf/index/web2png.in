The gif2png program converts files from the obsolescent Graphic Interchange
Format to Portable Network Graphics. The conversion preserves all graphic
information, including transparency, perfectly. The gif2png program can
even recover data from corrupted GIFs.

The distribution also includes a Python script, web2png, that will
convert entire web hierarchies (images and HTML or PHP pages).

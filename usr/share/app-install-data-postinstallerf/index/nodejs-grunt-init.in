Grunt is the JavaScript task runner.

Grunt-init is a scaffolding tool used to automate project creation when using
Grunt. It will build an entire directory structure based on the current
environment and the answers to a few questions. The exact files and contents
created depend on the template chosen along with the answers to the questions
asked.

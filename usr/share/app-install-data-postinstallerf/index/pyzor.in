Comment3='
Pyzor is a collaborative, networked system to detect
and block spam using identifying digests of messages.
Pyzor is similar to Vipuls Razor except implemented
in python, and using fully open source servers.

Pyzor can be used either standalone, or to augment the
spam filtering ability of spamassassin.  spamassassin
is highly recommended.

Comment3='
python-carrot is an AMQP messaging queue framework. AMQP is the Advanced
Message Queuing Protocol, an open standard protocol for message
orientation, queuing, routing, reliability and security.

The aim of python-carrot is to make messaging in Python as easy as possible
by providing a high-level interface for producing and consuming
messages. At the same time it is a goal to re-use what is already
available as much as possible.

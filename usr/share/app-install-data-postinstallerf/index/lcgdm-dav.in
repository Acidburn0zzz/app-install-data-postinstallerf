This package provides the HTTP/DAV front end to the LCGDM components
(DPM and LFC).

The Disk Pool Manager (DPM) is a lightweight grid storage component, allowing
access to data using commonly used grid protocols. The LCG File Catalog (LFC)
is the main catalog being used by grid communities for both file bookkeeping
and meta-data.

The Wave Sculpting Plugins (WASP) is a set of LADSPA plugins which includes both
processors and generators. While being pretty simple and not CPU-hungry, they
incorporate such interesting algorithms as a multi-mode wave shaper, noisifier,
clipping booster and variable noise source.

WASP is now part of the hydrogen drum machine.

perl-Pango provides Perl bindings for the text layout/rendering library
pango. Pango is a library for laying out and rendering text, with an
emphasis on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout
is needed, but using Pango in conjunction with Cairo and/or Gtk2 provides a
complete solution with high quality text handling and graphics rendering.

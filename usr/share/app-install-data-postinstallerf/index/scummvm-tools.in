This is a collection of various tools that may be useful to use in
conjunction with ScummVM.
Please note that although a tool may support a feature, certain ScummVM
versions may not. ScummVM 0.6.x does not support FLAC audio, for example.

Many games package together all their game data in a few big archive files.
The following tools can be used to extract these archives, and in some cases
are needed to make certain game versions usable with ScummVM.
The following tools can also be used to analyze the game scripts

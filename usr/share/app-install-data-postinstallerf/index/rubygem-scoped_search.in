Scoped search makes it easy to search your ActiveRecord-based models. It will
create a named scope search_for that can be called with a query string. It
will build an SQL query using the provided query string and a definition that
specifies on what fields to search. Because the functionality is built on
named_scope, the result of the search_for call can be used like any other
named_scope, so it can be chained with another scope or combined with
will_paginate. Because it uses standard SQL, it does not require any setup,
indexers or daemons. This makes scoped_search suitable to quickly add basic
search functionality to your application with little hassle. On the other hand,
it may not be the best choice if it is going to be used on very large data sets

Password Manager Daemon is a server that provides a way for applications
to securely store and retrieve data at a centralized location. The data is
stored in an (optionally AES256 encrypted) XML file and clients connect and
send commands to manipulate the data. Some of the features include

* Multi-threaded. More than one client may access the data at the same
  time.
* A key cache so clients wont need to enter a key each time a file is
  opened or saved.
* Key retrieval via pinentry(1).

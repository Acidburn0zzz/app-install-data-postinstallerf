Grunt is the JavaScript task runner. Why use a task runner? In one word
automation. The less work you have to do when performing repetitive tasks
like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc, the easier
your job becomes. After youve configured it, a task runner can do most
of that mundane work for you with basically zero effort.

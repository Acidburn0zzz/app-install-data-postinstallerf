The Automated Testing Framework (ATF) is a collection of libraries and
utilities designed to ease unattended application testing in the hands of
developers and end users of a specific piece of software.

As regards developers, ATF provides the necessary means to easily create
test suites composed of multiple test programs, which in turn are a
collection of test cases.  It also attempts to simplify the debugging of
problems when these test cases detect an error by providing as much
information as possible about the failure.

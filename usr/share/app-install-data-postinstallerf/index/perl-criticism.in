Comment3='
This pragma enforces coding standards and promotes best-practices by
running your file through PerlCritic before every execution. In a
production system, this usually isnt feasible because it adds a lot of
overhead at start-up. If you have a separate development environment, you
can effectively bypass the criticism pragma by not installing PerlCritic
in the production environment. If PerlCritic cant be loaded, then
criticism just fails silently.

Speex is a patent-free compression format designed especially for
speech. It is specialized for voice communications at low bit-rates in
the 2-45 kbps range. Possible applications include Voice over IP
(VoIP), Internet audio streaming, audio books, and archiving of speech
data (e.g. voice mail).

This is the MinGW version, built for the win32 target.

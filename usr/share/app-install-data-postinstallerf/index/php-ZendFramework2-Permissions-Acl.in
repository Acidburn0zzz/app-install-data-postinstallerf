Comment3='
The Zend\Permissions\Acl component provides a lightweight and flexible access
control list (ACL) implementation for privileges management. In general, an
application may utilize such ACL?s to control access to certain protected
objects by other requesting objects.

For the purposes of this documentation
* a resource is an object to which access is controlled.
* a role is an object that may request access to a Resource.

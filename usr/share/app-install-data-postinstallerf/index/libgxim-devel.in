libgxim is a X Input Method protocol library that is implemented by GObject.
this library helps you to implement XIM servers or client applications to
communicate through XIM protocol without using Xlib API directly, particularly
if your application uses GObject-based main loop.

This package contains the development files to make any applications with
libgxim.

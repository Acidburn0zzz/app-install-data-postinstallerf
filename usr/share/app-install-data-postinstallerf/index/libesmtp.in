LibESMTP is a library to manage posting (or submission of) electronic
mail using SMTP to a preconfigured Mail Transport Agent (MTA) such as
Exim. It may be used as part of a Mail User Agent (MUA) or another
program that must be able to post electronic mail but where mail
functionality is not the programs primary purpose.

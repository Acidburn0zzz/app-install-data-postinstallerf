GNU Common C++ is a portable and highly optimized class framework for writing
C++ applications that need to use threads, sockets, XML parsing,
serialization, config files, etc. This framework offers a class foundation
that hides platform differences from your C++ application so that you need
not write platform specific code. GNU Common C++ has been ported to compile
natively on most platforms which support posix threads.

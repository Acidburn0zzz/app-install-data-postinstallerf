The package gives LaTeX the power to retain mathematical
meaning of its expressions in addition to the typsetting
instructions; essentially separating style from the content of
the math. One advantage of keeping mathematical meaning is that
conversion of LaTeX documents to other executable formats (such
as Content MathML or Mathematica code) is greatly simplified.
The package requires the coolstr, coollist and forloop
packages.

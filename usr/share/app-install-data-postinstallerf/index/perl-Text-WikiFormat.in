The original Wiki web site had a very simple interface to edit and to
add pages.  Its formatting rules are simple and easy to use.  They are
also easy to translate into other, more complicated markup languages
with this module.  It creates HTML by default, but can produce valid
POD, DocBook, XML, or any other format imaginable.

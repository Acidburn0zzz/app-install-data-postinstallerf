The MgOpen fonts are a font family that includes Latin and Greek glyphs.
The fonts have been released under a liberal license, similar to the
license covering the Bitstream Vera fonts.

This package only exists to help transition pre Fedora 11 MgOpen font users to
the new package split. It will be removed after one distribution release cycle,
please do not reference it or depend on it in any way.
It can be safely uninstalled.

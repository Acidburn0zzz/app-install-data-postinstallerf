Comment3='
This library is a reimplementation of libdjb, which means that it provides
Daniel Bernsteins interfaces (with some extensions).

It contains wrappers around memory allocation, buffered I/O, routines for
formatting and scanning, a full DNS resolver, several socket routines,
wrappers for socket functions, mkfifo, opendir, wait, and an abstraction
around errno.  It also includes wrappers for Unix signal functions and a
layer of mmap and sendfile.
The library is available for use with the diet libc.

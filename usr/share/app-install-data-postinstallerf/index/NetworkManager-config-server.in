Comment3='
This adds a NetworkManager configuration file to make it behave more
like the old "network" service. In particular, it stops NetworkManager
from automatically running DHCP on unconfigured ethernet devices, and
allows connections with static IP addresses to be brought up even on
ethernet devices with no carrier.

This package is intended to be installed by default for server
deployments.

Whowatch is an interactive who-like program that displays information about the
users currently logged on to the machine, in real time. Besides standard
information (login name, tty, host, users process), the type of the connection
(ie. telnet or ssh) is shown. You can toggle display between users command or
idle time. You can watch processes tree, navigate in it and send INT and KILL
signals.

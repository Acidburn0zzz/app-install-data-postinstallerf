Comment3='
Xfce4 Dictionary is a client program to query different dictionaries. It can
query a Dict server (RFC 2229), open online dictionaries in a web browser or
verify the spelling of a word using enchant. This package contains the
stand-alone application, that can be used in different desktop environments
too.

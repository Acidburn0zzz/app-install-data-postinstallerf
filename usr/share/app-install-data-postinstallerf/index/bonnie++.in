Comment3='
bonnie++ filesystem and disk benchmark suite aggressively reads & writes
in various ways on your filesystem then outputs useful benchmark performance
data.  bonnie++ is also useful as a hardware, disk, and filesystem stability
test, exposing some types of hardware or kernel failures that would otherwise
be difficult to detect.

Do not leave bonnie++ installed on a production system.  Use only while you
test servers.

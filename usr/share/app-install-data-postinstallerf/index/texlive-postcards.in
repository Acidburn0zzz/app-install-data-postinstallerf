A modification of the standard LaTeX letter class which prints
multiple, pre-stamped, 5.5" by 3.5" postcards (a US standard
size) via the envlab and mailing packages. An address database
is employed to address the front side of each postcard and a
message is printed on the back side of all. An illustrative
example is provided.

Comment3='
CodeNarc is a static analysis tool for Groovy source code,
enabling monitoring and enforcement of many coding standards
and best practices. CodeNarc applies a set of Rules
(predefined and/or custom) that are applied to each Groovy
file, and generates an HTML report of the results, including
a list of rules violated for each source file, and a count
of the number of violations per package and for the whole
project.

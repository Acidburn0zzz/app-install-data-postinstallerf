Vala is a new programming language that aims to bring modern programming
language features to GNOME developers without imposing any additional
runtime requirements and without using a different ABI compared to
applications and libraries written in C.

This package contains tools to generate Vala projects, as well as API
bindings from existing C libraries, allowing access from Vala programs.

CGI.pm is a stable, complete and mature solution for processing and preparing
HTTP requests and responses. Major features including processing form
submissions, file uploads, reading and writing cookies, query string
generation and manipulation, and processing and preparing HTTP headers. Some
HTML generation utilities are included as well.

CGI.pm performs very well in in a vanilla CGI.pm environment and also comes
with built-in support for mod_perl and mod_perl2 as well as FastCGI.

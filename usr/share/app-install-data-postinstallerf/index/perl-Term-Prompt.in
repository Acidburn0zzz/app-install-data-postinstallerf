This main function of this module is to accept interactive input. You
specify the type of inputs allowed, a prompt, help text and defaults and it
will deal with the user interface, (and the user!), by displaying the
prompt, showing the default, and checking to be sure that the response is
one of the legal choices. Additional types that could be added would be a
phone type, a social security type, a generic numeric pattern type...

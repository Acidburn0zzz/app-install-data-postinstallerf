Graphite2 is a project within SIL?s Non-Roman Script Initiative and Language
Software Development groups to provide rendering capabilities for complex
non-Roman writing systems. Graphite can be used to create ?smart fonts? capable
of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors. With respect to
the Text Encoding Model, Graphite handles the "Rendering" aspect of writing

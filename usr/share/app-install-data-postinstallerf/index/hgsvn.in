This set of scripts allows to work locally on subversion managed
projects using the mercurial distributed version control system.

Why use mercurial? You can do local (disconnected) work, pull the
latest changes from the subversion server, manage private branches,
submit patches to project maintainers, etc. And of course you have
fast local operations like hg log and hg annotate.

Seren is a simple VoIP program based on the Opus codec that allows you
to create a voice conference from the terminal, with up to 10
participants, without having to register accounts, exchange emails, or
add people to contact lists.
All you need to join an existing conference is the host name or IP
address of one of the participants.
Seren creates a dynamic peer-to-peer network of equivalent nodes which
exchange text and audio data using a UDP connection, and offers the
user the ability to change the quality/bitrate on the fly, encrypt the
traffic and record the calls.

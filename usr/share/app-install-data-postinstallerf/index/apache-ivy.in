Apache Ivy is a tool for managing (recording, tracking, resolving and
reporting) project dependencies.  It is designed as process agnostic and is
not tied to any methodology or structure. while available as a standalone
tool, Apache Ivy works particularly well with Apache Ant providing a number
of powerful Ant tasks ranging from dependency resolution to dependency
reporting and publication.

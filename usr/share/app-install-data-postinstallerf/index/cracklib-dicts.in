The cracklib-dicts package includes the CrackLib dictionaries.
CrackLib will need to use the dictionary appropriate to your system,
which is normally put in /usr/share/dict/words. Cracklib-dicts also
contains the utilities necessary for the creation of new dictionaries.

If you are installing CrackLib, you should also install cracklib-dicts.

Unicode Viewer is a tool for browsing Unicode tables to obtain detailed
information about every glyph. It provides a GUI with multiple functions
for navigating through the data and a Lua scripting interface to create
new functions. It also displays each glyphs DUCET-information and
allows sorting according to an order specified in an allkeys.txt-File.

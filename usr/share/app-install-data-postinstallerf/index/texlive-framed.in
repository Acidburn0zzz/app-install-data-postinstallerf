The package creates three environments - framed, which puts an
ordinary frame box around the region, - shaded, which shades
the region, and - leftbar, which places a line at the left
side. The environments allow a break at their start (the
\FrameCommand enables creation of a title that is "attached" to
the environment); breaks are also allowed in the course of the
framed/shaded matter. There is also a command \MakeFramed to
make your own framed-style environments.

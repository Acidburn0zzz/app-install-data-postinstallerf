Prawn is a pure Ruby PDF generation library that provides a lot of great
functionality while trying to remain simple and reasonably performant.
Here are some of the important features we provide

- Vector drawing support, including lines, polygons, curves, ellipses, etc.
- Extensive text rendering support, including flowing text and limited inline
  formatting options.
- Support for both PDF builtin fonts as well as embedded TrueType fonts
- A variety of low level tools for basic layout needs, including a simple
  grid system

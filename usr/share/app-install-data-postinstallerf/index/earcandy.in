Comment3='
A sound level manager that nicely fades applications in and out based on
their profile and window focus. It is useful if you need to fade out music
or video players during VoIP calls, switch to music player with focus when
more using than one, push sound to USB headsets on plugin, etc. Settings
can be configured via nice and simple UI.

Nyquist is a language for sound synthesis and music
composition. Unlike score languages that tend to deal only with
events, or signal processing languages that tend to deal only with
signals and synthesis, Nyquist handles both in a single integrated
system. Nyquist is also flexible and easy to use because it is based
on an interactive Lisp interpreter.

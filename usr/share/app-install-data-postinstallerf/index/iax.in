Comment3='
Inter Asterisk eXchange, lovingly called IAX (pronounced eeks), is the
protocol used by the Asterisk PBX system for inter-asterisk-communication.
Other applications may use libiax to communicate with each other and other
asterisk servers.  IAX is a high performance, feature rich protocol unrelated
to SIP or H.323.  Its single-socket design allows it to interoperate with NAT
and PAT masquerade firewalls.  It supports internationalization, remote
dialplans, and voice, HTML, image, DTMF, and video content.

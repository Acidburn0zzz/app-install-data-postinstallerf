Ballz is a platformer with some puzzle elements. You take control of a ball
which is genetically modified by the British secret service. Your mission is
to rescue captured British soldiers from a prison in Iran.

The game was written in 72 hours for the TINS competition, a competition
similar to Speedhack. The name TINS is an recursive acronym for ?TINS is
not Speedhack?.

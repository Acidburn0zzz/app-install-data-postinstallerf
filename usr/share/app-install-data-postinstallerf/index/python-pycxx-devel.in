PyCXX is a set of classes to help create extensions of Python in the
C++ language. The first part encapsulates the Python C API taking care
of exceptions and ref counting. The second part supports the building
of Python extension modules in C++.

The python-pycxx-devel package provides the header and source files
for Python 2.  There is no non-devel package needed.

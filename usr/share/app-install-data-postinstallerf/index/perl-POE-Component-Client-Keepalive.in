Comment3='
POEComponentClientKeepalive creates and manages connections for other
components. It maintains a cache of kept-alive connections for quick reuse. It
is written specifically for clients that can benefit from kept-alive
connections, such as HTTP clients. Using it for one-shot connections would
probably be silly.

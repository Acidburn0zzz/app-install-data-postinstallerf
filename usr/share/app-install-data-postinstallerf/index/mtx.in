The MTX program controls the robotic mechanism in autoloaders and tape
libraries such as the HP SureStore DAT 40x6, Exabyte EZ-17, and
Exabyte 220. This program is also reported to work with a variety of
other tape libraries and autochangers from ADIC, Tandberg/Overland,
Breece Hill, HP, and Seagate.

If you have a backup tape device capable of handling more than one
tape at a time, you should install MTX.

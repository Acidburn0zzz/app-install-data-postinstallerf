AUCTeX is an extensible package that supports writing and formatting
TeX files for most variants of Emacs.

AUCTeX supports many different TeX macro packages, including AMS-TeX,
LaTeX, Texinfo and basic support for ConTeXt.  Documentation can be
found under /usr/share/doc, e.g. the reference card (tex-ref.pdf) and
the FAQ. The AUCTeX manual is available in Emacs info (C-h i d m
AUCTeX RET). On the AUCTeX home page, we provide manuals in various
formats.

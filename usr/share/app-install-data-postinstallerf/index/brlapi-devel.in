This package provides the header files, static archive, shared object
linker reference, and reference documentation for BrlAPI (the
Application Programming Interface to BRLTTY).  It enables the
implementation of applications which take direct advantage of a
refreshable braille display in order to present information in ways
which are more appropriate for blind users and/or to provide user
interfaces which are more specifically attuned to their needs.

Install this package if you are developing or maintaining an application
which directly accesses a refreshable braille display.

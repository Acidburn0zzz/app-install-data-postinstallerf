The ArchiveZip module allows a Perl program to create, manipulate,
read, and write Zip archive files.
Zip archives can be created, or you can read from existing zip files.
Once created, they can be written to files, streams, or strings.
Members can be added, removed, extracted, replaced, rearranged, and
enumerated.  They can also be renamed or have their dates, comments,
or other attributes queried or modified.  Their data can be compressed
or uncompressed as needed.  Members can be created from members in
existing Zip files, or from existing directories, files, or strings.

Log4c is a C language library for flexible logging to files, syslog and other
destinations. It is modeled after the Log for Java library (log4j),
staying as close to their API as is reasonable.

This package contains development files for log4c. If you like to develop
programs using log4c, you will need to install log4c-devel.

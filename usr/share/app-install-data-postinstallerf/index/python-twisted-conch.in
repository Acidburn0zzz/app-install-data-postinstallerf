Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications.

Conch is an SSHv2 implementation written in Python. SSH is a protocol designed
to allow remote access to shells and commands, but it is generic enough to
allow everything from TCP forwarding to generic filesystem access. Since conch
is written in Python, it interfaces well with other Python projects, such as
Imagination. Conch also includes a implementations of the telnet and vt102
protocols, as well as support for rudamentary line editing behaviors. A new
implementation of Twisteds Manhole application is also included, featuring
server-side input history and interactive syntax coloring.

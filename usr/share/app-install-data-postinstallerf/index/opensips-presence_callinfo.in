The module enables the handling of "call-info" and "line-seize" events inside
the presence module. It is used with the general event handling module
presence and it constructs and adds "Call-Info" headers to notification events.
To send "call-info" notification to watchers, a third-party application must
publish "call-info" events to the presence server.

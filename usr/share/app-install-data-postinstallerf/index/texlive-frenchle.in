This is a redistribution and repackaging of the late Bernard
Gaulles "light" package to typeset French documents according
to the rules of the "Imprimerie Nationale". The package offers
a package, two Babel language definition files (french.ldf and
frenchle.ldf), and a package to enable the non-standard
definition files to be loaded into an unmodified Babel. The
user may simply use frenchle.sty if typesetting a French-only
document, but should use Babel with the frenchle option for a
multilingual document.

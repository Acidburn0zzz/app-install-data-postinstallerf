Rsyslog is an enhanced, multi-threaded syslog daemon. It supports MySQL,
syslog/TCP, RFC 3195, permitted sender lists, filtering on any message part,
and fine grain output format control. It is compatible with stock sysklogd
and can be used as a drop-in replacement. Rsyslog is simple to set up, with
advanced features suitable for enterprise-class, encryption-protected syslog
relay chains.

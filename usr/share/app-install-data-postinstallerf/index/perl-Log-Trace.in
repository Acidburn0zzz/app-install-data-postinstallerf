This module provides a unified approach to tracing. A script can use
LogTrace qw( < mode > ) to set the behaviour of the TRACE function.By
default, the trace functions are exported to the calling package only.
You can export the trace functions to other packages with the Deep
option. See the "OPTIONS" manpage for more information.

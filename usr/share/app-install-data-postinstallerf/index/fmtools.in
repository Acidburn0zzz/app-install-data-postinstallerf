This is a pair of hopefully useful control programs for Video for Linux
(v4l2) radio card drivers.  The focus is on control, so you may find these
programs a bit unfriendly.  Users are encouraged to investigate the source
and create wrappers or new programs based on this design.

fm      - a simple tuner
fmscan  - a simple band scanner

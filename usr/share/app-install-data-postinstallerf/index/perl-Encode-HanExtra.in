Comment3='
Perl 5.7.3 and later ships with an adequate set of Chinese encodings,
including the commonly used CP950, CP936 (also known as GBK), Big5 (alias
for Big5-Eten), Big5-HKSCS, EUC-CN, HZ, and ISO-IR-165.
However, the numbers of Chinese encodings are staggering, and a complete
coverage will easily increase the size of perl distribution by several
megabytes; hence, this CPAN module tries to provide the rest of them.
If you are using Perl 5.8 or later, EncodeCN and EncodeTW will
automatically load the extra encodings for you, so theres no need to
explicitly write use EncodeHanExtra if you are using one of them already.

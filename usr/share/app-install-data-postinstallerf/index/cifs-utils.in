The SMB/CIFS protocol is a standard file sharing protocol widely deployed
on Microsoft Windows machines. This package contains tools for mounting
shares on Linux using the SMB/CIFS protocol. The tools in this package
work in conjunction with support in the kernel to allow one to mount a
SMB/CIFS share onto a client and use it as if it were a standard Linux
file system.

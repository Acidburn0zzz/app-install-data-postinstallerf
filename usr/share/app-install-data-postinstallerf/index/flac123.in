flac123 is a command-line program for playing FLAC audio files.

FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) is an open format for losslessly
compressing audio data.  Grossly oversimplified, FLAC is similar to
Ogg Vorbis, but lossless.
flac123 implements mpg123s Remote Control interface via option -R.
This is useful if youre writing a frontend to flac123 which needs a
consistent, reliable interface to control playback.

In "Die TeXnische Komodie" (issue 1/2013) Christian Justen
described his use of LaTeX in his work as priest (similar
requirements may be encountered in the work of pastors and
other ministers of religion). One point was to arrange A5 pages
onto A4 landscape paper, either side-by-side or as a booklet.
Justen made two bash scripts for this job; the package provides
one texlua script for both requirements. (Note that file
a5toa4.tlu should have execute permissions in any
installation.)

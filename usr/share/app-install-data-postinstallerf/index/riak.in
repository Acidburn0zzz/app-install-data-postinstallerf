Riak is a Dynamo-inspired key/value store that scales predictably and easily.
Riak also simplifies development by giving developers the ability to quickly
prototype, test, and deploy their applications.

A truly fault-tolerant system, Riak has no single point of failure. No machines
are special or central in Riak, so developers and operations professionals can
decide exactly how fault-tolerant they want and need their applications to be.

A debugger is an important tool for development. The Mono
Debugger (MDB) can debug both managed and unmanaged applications.
It provides a reusable library that can be used to add debugger
functionality to different frontends. The debugger package
includes a console debugger named "mdb", and MonoDevelop
provides a GUI interface to the debugger.

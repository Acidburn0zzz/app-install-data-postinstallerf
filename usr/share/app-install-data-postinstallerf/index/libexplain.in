The libexplain project provides a library which may be used to explain
Unix and Linux system call errors. This will make your applications
error messages much more informative to your users.  The library is
not quite a drop-in replacement for strerror, but it comes close. Each
system call has a dedicated libexplain function.

The coverage for system calls is being improved all the time. Coverage
includes 159 system calls and 444 ioctl requests.

Task Coach is a simple open source todo manager to
manage personal tasks and todo lists. It grew out of a
frustration that well-known task managers, such as those
provided with Outlook or Lotus Notes, do not provide
facilities for composite tasks. Often,
tasks and other things todo consist of several activities.
Task Coach is designed to deal with composite tasks.

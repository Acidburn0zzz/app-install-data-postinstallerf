ZendI18n comes with a complete translation suite which supports all major
formats and includes popular features like plural translations and text
domains. The Translator component is mostly dependency free, except for
the fallback to a default locale, where it relies on the Intl PHP extension.

The translator itself is initialized without any parameters, as any
configuration to it is optional. A translator without any translations
will actually do nothing but just return the given message IDs.

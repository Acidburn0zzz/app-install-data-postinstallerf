Comment3='
Most allinone PCs and bluetooth keyboard / mouse sets which include a
bluetooth dongle, ship with a so called HID proxying bluetooth HCI.
The HID proxying makes the keyboard / mouse show up as regular USB HID
devices (after connecting using the connect button on the device + keyboard),
which makes them work without requiring any manual configuration.

The bluez-hid2hci package contains the hid2hci utility and udev rules to
automatically switch supported Bluetooth devices into regular HCI mode.
Install this package if you want to use the bluetooth function of the HCI

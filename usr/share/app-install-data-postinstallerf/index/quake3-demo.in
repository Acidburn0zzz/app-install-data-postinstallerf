Comment3='
Quake 3 Arena tournament 3D shooter game demo installer. The Quake3 engine is
Open Source and as such is available as part of Fedora. The original Quake3
datafiles however are not Open Source and thus are not available as part of
Fedora. There is a gratis, but not Open Source demo available on the internet.

This package installs an applications menu entry for playing the Quake3 Arena
demo. The first time you click this menu entry, it will offer to download and
install the Quake 3 demo datafiles for you.

Comment3='
A Python library for making CIM (Common Information Model) operations over HTTP
using the WBEM CIM-XML protocol. It is based on the idea that a good WBEM
client should be easy to use and not necessarily require a large amount of
programming knowledge. It is suitable for a large range of tasks from simply
poking around to writing web and GUI applications.

WBEM, or Web Based Enterprise Management is a manageability protocol, like
SNMP, standardised by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) available
at http//www.dmtf.org/standards/wbem.

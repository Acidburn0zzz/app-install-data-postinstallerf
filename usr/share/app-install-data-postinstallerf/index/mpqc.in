MPQC is the Massively Parallel Quantum Chemistry Program. It computes
properties of atoms and molecules from first principles using the time
independent Schr?dinger equation. It runs on a wide range of
architectures ranging from individual workstations to symmetric
multiprocessors to massively parallel computers. Its design is object
oriented, using the C++ programming language.

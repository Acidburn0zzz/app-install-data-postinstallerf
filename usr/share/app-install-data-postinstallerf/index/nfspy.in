NfSpy is a Python library for automating the falsification of NFS credentials
when mounting an NFS share. Included are two client programs

- nfspy uses the Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) library to mount an NFS share
  in Linux. This allows the use of any regular file-searching and manipulation
  programs like grep and find to explore the NFS export.
- nfspysh is a ftp-like interactive shell for exploring NFS exports. It does
  not require the FUSE library, so it can run on non-Linux platforms.

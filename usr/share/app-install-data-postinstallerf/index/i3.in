Key features of i3 are correct implementation of XrandR, horizontal and vertical
columns (think of a table) in tiling. Also, special focus is on writing clean,
readable and well documented code. i3 uses xcb for asynchronous communication
with X11, and has several measures to be very fast.

Please be aware that i3 is primarily targeted at advanced users and developers.

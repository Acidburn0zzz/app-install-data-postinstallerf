Comment3='
libibverbs is a library that allows userspace processes to use RDMA
the RDMA Protocol Verbs Specification.  This includes direct hardware
access from userspace to InfiniBand/iWARP adapters (kernel bypass) for
fast path operations.

For this library to be useful, a device-specific plug-in module should
also be installed.

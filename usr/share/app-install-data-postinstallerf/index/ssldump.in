Comment3='
This program is an SSLv3/TLS network protocol analyzer. It identifies TCP
connections on the chosen network interface and attempts to interpret them
as SSLv3/TLS traffic. When ssldump identifies SSLv3/TLS traffic, ssldump
decodes the records and displays them in a textual form to stdout. And if
provided with the appropriate keying material, ssldump will also decrypt
the connections and display the application data traffic. This program is
based on tcpdump, a network monitoring and data acquisition tool.

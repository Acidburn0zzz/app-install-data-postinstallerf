should is an expressive, readable, test framework agnostic, behavior-driven
development (BDD)-style assertion library for Node.js.

It extends the Object prototype with a single non-enumerable getter that
allows you to express how that object should behave.
should literally extends Nodes assert module. For example,
should.equal(str, foo) will work, just as assert.equal(str, foo) would,
and should.AssertionError is assert.AssertionError, meaning any test framework
supporting this constructor will function properly with should.

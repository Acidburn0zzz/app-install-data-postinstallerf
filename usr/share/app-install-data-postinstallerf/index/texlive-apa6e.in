Comment3='
This is a minimalist class file for formatting manuscripts in
the style described in the American Psychological Association
(APA) 6th edition guidelines. Some day, the established (and
more capable) apa class will perhaps gain support for the 6th
edition of the APA guidelines, in which case users should
probably use it instead. But in the mean time, this class may
be useful.

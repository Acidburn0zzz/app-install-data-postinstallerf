Comment3='
Wicd is designed to give the user as much control over behavior of network
connections as possible.  Every network, both wired and wireless, has its
own profile with its own configuration options and connection behavior.
Wicd will try to automatically connect only to networks the user specifies
it should try, with a preference first to a wired network, then to wireless.

This package provides the architecture-dependent components of wicd.

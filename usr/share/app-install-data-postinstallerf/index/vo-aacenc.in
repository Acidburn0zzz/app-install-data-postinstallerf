Comment3='
This library contains an encoder implementation of the Advanced Audio
Coding (AAC) audio codec. The library is based on a codec implementation
by VisualOn as part of the Stagefright framework from the Google
Android project.

This package is in the tainted section because the AAC encoding
standard is covered by patents.

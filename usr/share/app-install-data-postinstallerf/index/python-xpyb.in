The Python binding for XCB allows the X protocol to be accessed directly from
Python. There are two components

- A Python extension written in C. This exposes XCB-specific objects and
  library functions, as well as providing various base classes used by the
  generated code.
- Python modules which are generated directly from the XCB-XML protocol
  descriptions.

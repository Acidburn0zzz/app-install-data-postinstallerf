gkrellxmms2 is a gkrellm2 plugin for XMMS2. It has a title scroller with a
position marker and five buttons for playback control. The position marker
can be moved with the mouse to seek in the current track. The M button
opens a menu with two items for opening a trackinfo dialog and the media
library window.

STP (Simple Theorem Prover) is a constraint solver (also referred to as
a decision procedure or automated prover) aimed at solving constraints
generated by program analysis tools, theorem provers, automated bug
finders, intelligent fuzzers and model checkers.  STP has been used in
many research projects at Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, CMU and other
universities, as well as companies and government agencies.

The input to STP are formulas over the theory of bit-vectors and arrays
(this theory captures most expressions from languages like C/C++/Java
and Verilog), and the output of STP is a single bit of information that

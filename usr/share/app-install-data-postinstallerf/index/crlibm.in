Comment3='
CRlibm is a free mathematical library (libm) which provides
* implementations of the double-precision C99 standard elementary functions,
* correctly rounded in the four IEEE-754 rounding modes,
* with a comprehensive proof of both the algorithms used and their
  implementation,
* sufficiently efficient in average time, worst-case time, and memory
  consumption to replace existing libms transparently.

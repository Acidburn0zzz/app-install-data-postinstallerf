In many countries digital radio and television uses the Digital Video
Broadcasting (DVB) standard to broadcast its data. Project X is a tool
to analyse and manipulate these DVB MPEG data streams. It can cut and
demultiplex them and it tries its best to handle and repair many
stream types and show what went wrong on reception.

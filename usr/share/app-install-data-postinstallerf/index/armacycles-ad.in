Comment3='
In this game you ride a lightcycle; that is a sort of motorbike that
cannot be stopped and leaves a wall behind it. The main goal of the game
is to make your opponents lightcycles crash into a wall while avoiding
the same fate.
The focus of the game lies on the multiplayer mode, but it provides
challanging AI opponents for a quick training match.

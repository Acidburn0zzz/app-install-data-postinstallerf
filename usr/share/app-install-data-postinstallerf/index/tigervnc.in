Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a remote display system which
allows you to view a computing desktop environment not only on the
machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the Internet and
from a wide variety of machine architectures.  This package contains a
client which will allow you to connect to other desktops running a VNC
server.

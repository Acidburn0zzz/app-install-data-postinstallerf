exchange big files on the Internet. It is written in a wonderful language,
called Objective-Caml, and present most features of the basic Windows donkey
client, plus some more
- It should work on most UNIX-compatible platforms.
- You can remotely command your client, either by telnet (port 4000),
    by a WEB browser (http//localhost4080), or with a classical client
    interface (see http//www.nongnu.org/mldonkey)
- You can connect to several servers, and each search will query all the
    connected servers.

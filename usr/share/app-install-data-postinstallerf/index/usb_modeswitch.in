USB Modeswitch brings up your datacard into operational mode. When plugged
in they identify themselves as cdrom and present some non-Linux compatible
installation files. This tool deactivates this cdrom-devices and enables
the real communication device. It supports most devices built and
sold by Huawei, T-Mobile, Vodafone, Option, ZTE, Novatel.

XOM is a new XML object model. It is an open source (LGPL),
tree-based API for processing XML with Java that strives
for correctness, simplicity, and performance, in that order.
XOM is designed to be easy to learn and easy to use. It
works very straight-forwardly, and has a very shallow
learning curve. Assuming youre already familiar with XML,
you should be able to get up and running with XOM very quickly.

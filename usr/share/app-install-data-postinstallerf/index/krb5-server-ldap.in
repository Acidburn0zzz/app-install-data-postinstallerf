Kerberos is a network authentication system. The krb5-server package
contains the programs that must be installed on a Kerberos 5 key
distribution center (KDC).  If you are installing a Kerberos 5 KDC,
and you wish to use a directory server to store the data for your
realm, you need to install this package.

The "xappy" python module is an easy-to-use interface to the Xapian
search engine. Xapian provides a low level interface, dealing with terms
and documents, but not really worrying about where terms come from, or
how to build searches to match the way in which data has been indexed. In
contrast, "xappy" allows you to design a field structure, specifying what
kind of information is held in particular fields, and then uses this
field structure to index data appropriately, and to build and perform
searches.

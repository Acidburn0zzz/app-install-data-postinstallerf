bibexport.sh is a small shell script, relying on BibTeX, that extracts
entries of one or several bib file(s). It will expand abbreviations
and cross-references, except standard month and journal
abbreviations. The output is indented as neatly as possible, yielding a
readable bib file even if the original one was not.

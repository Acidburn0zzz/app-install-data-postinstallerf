Comment3='
This is the NetIP module for Perl, designed to allow easy
manipulation of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  Two applications using the
NetIP module are included ipcount, an IP address mini-calculator,
it can calculate the number of IP addresses in a prefix or all the
prefixes contained in a given range; and iptab, which prints out a
handy IP "cheat sheet".

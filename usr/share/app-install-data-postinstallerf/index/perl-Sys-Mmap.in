Comment3='
The Mmap module lets you use mmap to map in a file as a perl variable rather
than reading the file into dynamically allocated memory.  Multiple programs may
map the same file into memory, and immediately see changes by each other.
Memory may be allocated not attached to a file, and shared with subprocesses.

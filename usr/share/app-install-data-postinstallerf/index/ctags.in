Ctags generates an index (or tag) file of C language objects found in
C source and header files.  The index makes it easy for text editors or
other utilities to locate the indexed items.  Ctags can also generate a
cross reference file which lists information about the various objects
found in a set of C language files in human readable form.  Exuberant
Ctags improves on ctags because it can find all types of C language tags,
including macro definitions, enumerated values (values inside enum{...}),
function and method definitions, enum/struct/union tags, external
function prototypes, typedef names and variable declarations.  Exuberant
Ctags is far less likely to be fooled by code containing #if preprocessor

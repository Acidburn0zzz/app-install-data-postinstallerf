This module is a wrapper around GetoptLong that extends the value of
the original GetoptLong module to

1) add a simple graphical user interface option screen if no arguments
   are passed to the program.  Thus, the arguments to actually use are
   built based on the results of the user interface. If arguments were
   passed to the program, the user interface is not shown and the
   program executes as it normally would and acts just as if
   GetoptLongGetOptions had been called instead.  This requires
   the QWizard and Gtk2 or Tk interfaces to be installed too.

The bison-devel package contains the -ly library sometimes used by
programs using Bison-generated parsers.  If you are developing programs
using Bison, you might want to link with this library.  This library
is not required by all Bison-generated parsers, but may be employed by
simple programs to supply minimal support for the generated parsers.

Cacti is a complete frontend to RRDTool. It stores all of the
necessary information to create graphs and populate them with
data in a MySQL database. The frontend is completely PHP
driven. Along with being able to maintain graphs, data
sources, and round robin archives in a database, Cacti also
handles the data gathering. There is SNMP support for those
used to creating traffic graphs with MRTG.

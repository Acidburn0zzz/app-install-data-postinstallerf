Pymacs is a powerful tool which, once started from Emacs, allows
both-way communication between Emacs Lisp and Python. Pymacs aims
Python as an extension language for Emacs rather than the other way
around, and this asymmetry is reflected in some design choices. Within
Emacs Lisp code, one may load and use Python modules. Python functions
may themselves use Emacs services, and handle Emacs Lisp objects kept
in Emacs Lisp space.

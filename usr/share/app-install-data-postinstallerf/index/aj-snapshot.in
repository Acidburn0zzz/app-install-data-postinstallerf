aj-snapshot is a small program that can be used to make snapshots of the
connections made between JACK and/or ALSA clients. Because JACK can provide
both audio and MIDI support to programs, aj-snapshot can store both types of
connections for JACK. ALSA, on the other hand, only provides routing
facilities for MIDI clients. You can also run aj-snapshot in daemon mode if
you want to have your connections continually restored.

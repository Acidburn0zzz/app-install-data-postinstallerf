LectroTest is an automated, specification-based testing system. To use it,
declare properties that specify the expected behavior of your software. Then
invoke LectroTest to test whether those properties hold.

LectroTest does this by running repeated random trials against your software.
If LectroTest finds that a property doesnt hold, it emits the counterexample
that "broke" your software. You can then plug the counterexample into your
software to debug the problem.

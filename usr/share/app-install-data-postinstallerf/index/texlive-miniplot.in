MiniPlot is a package to help the LaTeX user typeset EPS
figures using an easy-to-use interface. Figures can be arranged
as one-figure-only or as a collection of figures in columns and
rows which can itself contain sub-figures in columns and rows.
Wrapped figures are also supported. This package provides
commands to display a framebox instead of the figure as the
graphics package does already but additionally it writes useful
information such as the label and scaling factor into these
boxes.

Comment3='
This module provides a common interface for obtaining the RGB values of
colors by standard names. The intention is to (1) provide a common module
that authors can use with other modules to specify colors by name; and (2)
free module authors from having to "re-invent the wheel" whenever they
decide to give the users the option of specifying a color by name rather
than RGB value.

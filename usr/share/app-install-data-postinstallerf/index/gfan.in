The software computes all marked reduced Gr?bner bases of an ideal.
Their union is a universal Gr?bner basis. Gfan contains algorithms for
computing this complex for general ideals and specialized algorithms
for tropical curves, tropical hypersurfaces and tropical varieties of
prime ideals. In addition to the above core functions the package
contains many tools which are useful in the study of Gr?bner bases,
initial ideals and tropical geometry. Among these are an interactive
traversal program for Gr?bner fans and programs for graphical renderings.

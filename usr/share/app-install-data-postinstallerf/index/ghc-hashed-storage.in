Comment3='
Support code for reading and manipulating hashed file storage (where each file
and directory is associated with a cryptographic hash, for corruption-resistant
storage and fast comparisons).

The supported storage formats include darcs hashed pristine, a plain filesystem
tree and an indexed plain tree (where the index maintains hashes of the plain
files and directories).

Googsystray is a system tray app for Google Voice, GMail, Google Calendar,
Google Reader, and Google Wave. The idea is to be able to keep track of all
that stuff without having to keep a bunch of browser tabs open, or constantly
checking them. It notifies on new messages, alerts, etc., and provides basic
services quickly (Reading or sending a new SMS message, or marking an email
read, for example.)

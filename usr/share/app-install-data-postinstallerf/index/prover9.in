This package provides the Prover9 resolution/paramodulation theorem prover
and the Mace4 countermodel generator.

Prover9 is an automated theorem prover for first-order and equational logic.
It is a successor of the Otter prover. Prover9 uses the inference techniques
of ordered resolution and paramodulation with literal selection.
The program Mace4 searches for finite structures satisfying first-order and
equational statements, the same kind of statement that Prover9 accepts. If
the statement is the denial of some conjecture, any structures found by

The \DeclareCaption command defines a class of caption command
associated with the counter specified to the command. These
commands are free-standing (i.e., dont need to be inside a
float environment). The package uses \DeclareCaption to define
\figcaption and \tabcaption, which can be used outside figure
or table environments.

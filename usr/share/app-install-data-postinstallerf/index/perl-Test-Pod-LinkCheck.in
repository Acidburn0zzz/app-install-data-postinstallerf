This module looks for any links in your POD and verifies that they point to
a valid resource. It uses the PodSimple parser to analyze the pod files
and look at their links. In a nutshell, it looks for L<Foo> links and makes
sure that Foo exists. It also recognizes section links, L</SYNOPSIS> for
example. Also, manual pages are resolved and checked.

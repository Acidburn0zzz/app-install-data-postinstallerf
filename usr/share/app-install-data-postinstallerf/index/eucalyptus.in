Eucalyptus is a service overlay that implements elastic computing
using existing resources. The goal of Eucalyptus is to allow sites
with existing clusters and server infrastructure to co-host an elastic
computing service that is interface-compatible with Amazon AWS.

This package contains the common parts; you will need to install at
least one of the cloud controller (cloud), cluster controller (cc),
node controller (nc), storage controller (sc), or walrus packages as well.

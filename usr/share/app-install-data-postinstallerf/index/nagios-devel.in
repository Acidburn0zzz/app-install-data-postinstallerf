Nagios is a program that will monitor hosts and services on your
network. It has the ability to email or page you when a problem arises
and when a problem is resolved. Nagios is written in C and is
designed to run under Linux (and some other *NIX variants) as a
background process, intermittently running checks on various services
that you specify.

This package provides include files that Nagios-related applications
may compile against.

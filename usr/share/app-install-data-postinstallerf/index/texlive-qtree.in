The package offers support for drawing tree diagrams, and is
especially suitable for linguistics use. It allows trees to be
specified in a simple bracket notation, automatically
calculates branch sizes, and supports both DVI/PostScript and
PDF output by use of pict2e facilities. The package is a
development of the existing qobitree package, offering a new
front end.

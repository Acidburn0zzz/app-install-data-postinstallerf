Disser comprises a document class and set of templates for
typesetting dissertations in Russian. One of its primary
advantages is a simplicity of format specification for
titlepage, headers and elements of automatically generated
lists (table of contents, list of figures, etc). Bibliography
styles, that conform to the requirements of the Russian
standard GOST R 7.0.11-2011, are provided.

The package offers a simple notation for pretty complex tables
(to Michael J. Fergusons credit). With PostScript, the package
allows shaded/coloured tables, diagonal rules, etc. The package
is supposed to work with both Plain and LaTeX. An AWK converter
from ASCII semigraphic tables to TAP notation is included.

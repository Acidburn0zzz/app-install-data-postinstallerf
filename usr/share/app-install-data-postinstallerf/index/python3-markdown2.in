Markdown is a text-to-HTML filter; it translates an easy-to-read /
easy-to-write structured text format into HTML. Markdowns text format
is most similar to that of plain text email, and supports features
such as headers, emphasis, code blocks, blockquotes, and links.

This is a fast and complete Python implementation of the Markdown
spec.

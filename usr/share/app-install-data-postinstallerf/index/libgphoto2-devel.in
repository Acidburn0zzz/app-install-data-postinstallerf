libgphoto2 is a library that can be used by applications to access
various digital cameras. libgphoto2 itself is not a GUI application,
opposed to gphoto. There are GUI frontends for the gphoto2 library,
however, such as gtkam for example.

This package contains files needed to compile applications that
use libgphoto2.

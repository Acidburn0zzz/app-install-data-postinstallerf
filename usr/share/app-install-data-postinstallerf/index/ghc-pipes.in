Pipes is a clean and powerful stream processing library that lets you build
and connect reusable streaming components

Advantages over traditional streaming libraries
* Concise API Use simple commands like for, (>->), await, and yield
* Blazing fast Implementation tuned for speed
* Lightweight Dependency pipes is small and compiles very rapidly,
  including dependencies
* Elegant semantics Use practical category theory
* ListT Correct implementation of ListT that interconverts with pipes

OpenVPN is a robust and highly flexible tunneling application that uses all
of the encryption, authentication, and certification features of the
OpenSSL library to securely tunnel IP networks over a single UDP or TCP
port.  It can use the Marcus Franz Xaver Johannes Oberhumers LZO library
for compression.

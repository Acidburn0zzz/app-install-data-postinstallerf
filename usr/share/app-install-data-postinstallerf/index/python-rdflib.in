RDFLib is a Python library for working with RDF, a simple yet powerful
language for representing information.

The library contains parsers and serializers for RDF/XML, N3,
NTriples, Turtle, TriX, RDFa and Microdata. The library presents
a Graph interface which can be backed by any one of a number of
Store implementations. The core rdflib includes store
implementations for in memory storage, persistent storage on top
of the Berkeley DB, and a wrapper for remote SPARQL endpoints.

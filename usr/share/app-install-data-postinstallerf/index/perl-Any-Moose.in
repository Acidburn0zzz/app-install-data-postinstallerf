Comment3='
AnyMoose is deprecated - please use Moo for new code.

This module allows one to take advantage of the features Moose/Mouse
provides, while allowing one to let the program author determine if Moose
or Mouse should be used; when used, we load Mouse if Moose isnt already
loaded, otherwise we go with Moose.

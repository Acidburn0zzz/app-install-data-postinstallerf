The package provides a means of reading Asymptote figures from
separate files, rather than within the document, as is standard
in the asymptote package, which is provided as part of the
Asymptote bundle. The asymptote way can prove cumbersome in a
large document; the present package allows the user to process
one picture at a time, in simple test documents, and then to
migrate (with no fuss) to their use in the target document.

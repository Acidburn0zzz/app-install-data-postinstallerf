TeXPower is a bundle of packages intended to provide an all-
inclusive environment for designing pdf screen presentations to
be viewed in full-screen mode, especially for projecting
`online with a video beamer. For some of its core functions,
it uses code derived from ppower4 packages. It is, however, not
a complete environment in itself it relies on an existing
class for preparing slides (such as foiltex or seminar) or
another package such as pdfslide.

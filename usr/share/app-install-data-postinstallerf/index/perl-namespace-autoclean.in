When you import a function into a Perl package, it will naturally also
be available as a method. The namespaceautoclean pragma will remove
all imported symbols at the end of the current packages compile cycle.
Functions called in the package itself will still be bound by their
name, but they wont show up as methods on your class or instances. This
module is very similar to namespaceclean, except it will clean all
imported functions, no matter if you imported them before or after you
used the pagma. It will also not touch anything that looks like a
method, according to ClassMOPClassget_method_list.

Comment3='
Written to address shortcomings in Nagios and Node-Runner, Limph uses a
PHP frontend with MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite backends.  It can check hosts
via UDP or a specific TCP port.  Includes a portscanning tool and host
discovery.  Includes user-based security and granular email notifications.
Can work with the Limph host agent to collect disk space and system load
information.

The use of formats helps to speed up compilations packages
which have been dumped in the format are loaded at very high
speed. This is useful when a document loads many packages
(including large packages such as pgf-TikZ). The package was
developed from the work in mylatex, and eliminates many of the
limitations and problems of that package.

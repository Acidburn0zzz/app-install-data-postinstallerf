Allows applications to define custom access modifiers programmatically,
to be enforced at compile time in the opt-in basis. Obviously,
theres no runtime check either - this is strictly a voluntary annotations.
This mechanism is useful for actually making sure that deprecated features
are not used (without actually removing such declarations, which would break
binary compatibility.)

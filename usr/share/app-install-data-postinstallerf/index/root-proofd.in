This package contains the PROOF server. Proofd is the core daemon of
the PROOF (Parallel ROOT Facility) system for distributed parallel
computing. Installing this package on a machine makes it possible
for the machine to participate in a parallel computing farm (cluster
or via the Internet), either as a master or a slave, using a
transparent interface.

This package provides a command-line tool for manipulating storage volume
encryption keys and storing them separately from volumes.

The main goal of the software is to allow restoring access to an encrypted
hard drive if the primary user forgets the passphrase.  The encryption key
back up can also be useful for extracting data after a hardware or software
failure that corrupts the header of the encrypted volume, or to access the
company data after an employee leaves abruptly.

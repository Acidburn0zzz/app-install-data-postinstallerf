Converts arbitrary national currency amounts using the Euro as
base unit, and typesets monetary amounts in almost any desired
way. Write, e.g., \ATS{17.6} to get something like 17,60 oS
(1,28 Euro) automatically. Conversion rates for the initial
Euro-zone countries are already built-in. Further rates can be
added easily. The package uses the fp package to do its sums.

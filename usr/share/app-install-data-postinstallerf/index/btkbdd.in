This tool starts a Bluetooth HID Keyboard service, serving keystrokes
obtained via Linux Input subsystems event device (evdev). In practical
terms, it turns your Linux box with a physical keyboard into a Bluetooth
keyboard, which can be used by various Bluetooth HID capable devices,
including desktop or tablet computers, smart phones, game consoles and so
on.

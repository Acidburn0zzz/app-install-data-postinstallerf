The FreeType engine is a free and portable font rendering
engine, developed to provide advanced font support for a variety of
platforms and environments. FreeType is a library which can open and
manages font files as well as efficiently load, hint and render
individual glyphs. FreeType is not a font server or a complete
text-rendering library.

This version is compiled with the patented subpixel rendering enabled.
It transparently overrides the system library using ld.so.conf.d.

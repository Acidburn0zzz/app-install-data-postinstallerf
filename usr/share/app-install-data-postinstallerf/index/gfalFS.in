Comment3='
gfalFS is a filesystem based on FUSE capable of operating on remote storage
systems managed by GFAL 2.0. This include the common file access protocols
in lcg ( SRM, GRIDFTP, DCAP, RFIO, LFN, ...). The practical effect is that
the user can seamlessly interact with grid and cloud storage systems just
as if they were local files.

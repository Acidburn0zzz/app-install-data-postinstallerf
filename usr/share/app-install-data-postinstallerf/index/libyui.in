Comment3='
This is the user interface engine that provides the abstraction from
graphical user interfaces (Qt, Gtk) and text based user interfaces
(ncurses).

Originally developed for YaST, libyui can now be used independently of
YaST for generic (C++) applications.
libyui has very few dependencies.

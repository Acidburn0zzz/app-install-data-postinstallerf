Comment3='
KInterbasDB is a Python extension package that implements Python Database API
2.0-compliant support for the open source relational database Firebird and some
versions of its proprietary cousin Borland Interbase.
In addition to the minimal feature set of the standard Python DB API,
KInterbasDB also exposes nearly the entire native client API of the database
engine.

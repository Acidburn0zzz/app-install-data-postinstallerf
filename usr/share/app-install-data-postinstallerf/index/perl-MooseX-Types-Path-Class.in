MooseXTypesPathClass creates common Moose types, coercions and option
specifications useful for dealing with PathClass objects as Moose attributes.

Coercions (see MooseUtilTypeConstraints) are made from both Str and
ArrayRef to both PathClassDir and PathClassFile objects.  If you
have MooseXGetopt installed, the Getopt option type ("=s") will be added
for both PathClassDir and PathClassFile.

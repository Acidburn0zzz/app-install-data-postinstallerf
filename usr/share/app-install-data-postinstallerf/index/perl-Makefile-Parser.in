Comment3='
This is a simple parser for Makefiles. At this very early stage, the parser
only supports a limited set of features, so it may not recognize most of
the advanced features provided by certain make tools like GNU make. Its
initial purpose is to provide basic support for another module named
MakefileGraphViz, which is aimed to render the building process specified
by a Makefile using the amazing GraphViz library. The Make module is not
satisfactory for this purpose, so I decided to build one of my own.

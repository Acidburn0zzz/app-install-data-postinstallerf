Open Babel is a free, open-source version of the Babel chemistry file
translation program. Open Babel is a project designed to pick up where
Babel left off, as a cross-platform program and library designed to
interconvert between many file formats used in molecular modeling,
computational chemistry, and many related areas.

This package contains the C++ library, which includes all of the
file-translation code.

Comment3='
The GNU Java getopt classes support short and long argument parsing in
a manner 100% compatible with the version of GNU getopt in glibc 2.0.6
with a mostly compatible programmers interface as well. Note that this
is a port, not a new implementation. I am currently unaware of any bugs
in this software, but there certainly could be some lying about. I would
appreciate bug reports as well as hearing about positive experiences.

Comment='<span size="xx-large">A 20th century italic Greek typeface</span>'
Comment3='
This typeface first appeared in the late 20s and was used as an alternative
italic type to the most commonly used Greek italics at the time, coming from
Germany (Leipsig). The name commemorates the edition of the Greek encyclop?dia
Pyrsos (1927-1933) from which the types were taken.

The font was digitally designed by George D. Matthiopoulos and is freely
available by GFS.

ApacheDS is an extensible and embeddable directory server
entirely written in Java, which has been certified LDAPv3
compatible by the Open Group. Besides LDAP it supports
Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol. It has been
designed to introduce triggers, stored procedures, queues and
views to the world of LDAP which has lacked these rich
constructs.

This package contains the shared APIs of the
Apache Directory Project.

The Astropy project is a common effort to develop a single core package
for Astronomy.  Major packages such as PyFITS, PyWCS, vo, and asciitable
already merged in, and many more components being worked on. In
particular, we are developing imaging, photometric, and spectroscopic
functionality, as well as frameworks for cosmology, unit handling, and
coordinate transformations.

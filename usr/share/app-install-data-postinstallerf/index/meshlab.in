MeshLab is an open source, portable, and extensible system for the
processing and editing of unstructured 3D triangular meshes.  The
system is aimed to help the processing of the typical not-so-small
unstructured models arising in 3D scanning, providing a set of tools
for editing, cleaning, healing, inspecting, rendering and converting
these kinds of meshes.

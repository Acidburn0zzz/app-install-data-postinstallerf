Plots stream of values read from standard input on the screen together with
statistics and a histogram.

Allows to instantly see how a signal generator, such as cyclictest, signaltest
or even ping, reacts when, for instance, its scheduling policy or real time
priority is changed, be it using tuna or plain chrt & taskset.

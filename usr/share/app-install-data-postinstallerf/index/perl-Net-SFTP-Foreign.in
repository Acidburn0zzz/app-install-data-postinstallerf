NetSFTPForeign is a Perl client for the SFTP version 3 as defined in the SSH
File Transfer Protocol IETF draft, draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-02.txt, included on
this package distribution, on the rfc directory.

NetSFTPForeign uses any compatible ssh command installed on the system (for
instance, OpenSSH ssh) to establish the secure connection to the remote server.
A wrapper module NetSFTPForeignCompat is also provided for compatibility
with NetSFTP.

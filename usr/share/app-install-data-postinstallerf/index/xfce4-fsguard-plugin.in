A little Xfce plugin, which checks the free space on the chosen mountpoint
frequently. It displays 4 different icons and a message box, depending on the
free space. The amount of free disk space is visible in a tooltip. If you
left-click on its icon, it opens the mountpoint directory in the file manager.

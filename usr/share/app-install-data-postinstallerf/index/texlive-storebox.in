The package provides "store boxes" whose user interface matches
that of normal LaTeX "save boxes", except that the content of a
store box appears at most once in the output PDF file, however
often it is used. The present version of the package supports
pdfLaTeX and LuaLaTeX; when DVI is output, store boxes behave
the same as save boxes.

This module is useful for feature development using the Features module[1].
Occasionally the Features module auto detects components that you do not want
exported to features. You can use this module to remove those auto-detected
components from any and all features you choose. The Features Plumber UI module
adds check boxes to the feature create form, and unchecking these detected
components will cause them to be removed from the actual generated export.

Comment3='
This Python package is a high-level wrapper for Kerberos (GSSAPI) operations.
The goal is to avoid having to build a module that wraps the entire
Kerberos.framework, and instead offer a limited set of functions that do what
is needed for client/serverKerberos authentication based on
<http//www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4559.txt>.

Much of the C-code here is adapted from Apaches mod_auth_kerb-5.0rc7.

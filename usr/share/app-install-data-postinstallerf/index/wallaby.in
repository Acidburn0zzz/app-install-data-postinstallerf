Comment3='
Wallaby is a configuration service for HTCondor pools.  It provides a
semantic model of HTCondor configurations, enabling administrators to
apply high-level features to groups of nodes rather than set the
values of low-level parameters in configuration files.  Wallaby also
validates configurations before deploying them, pushes out
configurations to affected nodes, keeps an inventory of running nodes,
and manages multiple versions of configurations.

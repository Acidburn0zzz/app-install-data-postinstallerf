Image_Text provides a comfortable interface to text manipulations in GD
images. Beside common Freetype2 functionality it offers to handle texts
in a graphic- or office-tool like way. For example it allows alignment of
texts inside a text box, rotation (around the top left corner of a text
box or its center point) and the automatic measurement of the optimal
font size for a given text box.

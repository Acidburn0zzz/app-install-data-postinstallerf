Comment3='
This is a re-implementation, for LaTeX 2e, of the original
Harvard package. The bundle contains the LaTeX package, several
BibTeX styles, and a Perl package for use with LaTeX2HTML.
Harvard is an author-year citation style (all but the first
author are suppressed in second and subsequent citations of the
same entry); the package defines several variant styles -
apsr.bst for the American Political Science Review; - agsm.bst
for Australian Government publications; - dcu.bst from the
Design Computing Unit of the University of Sydney; -
kluwer.bstwhich aims at the format preferred in Kluwer

TagLib# is a FREE and Open Source library for the .NET 2.0 and Mono frameworks
which will let you tag your software with as much or as little detail as you
like without slowing you down. It supports a large variety of movie and music
formats which abstract away the work, handling all the different cases, so all
you have to do is access file.Tag.Title, file.Tag.Lyrics, or my personal
favorite file.Tag.Pictures. But dont think all this abstraction is gonna keep
you from taggings greatest gems. You can still get to a specific tag types
features with just a few lines of code.

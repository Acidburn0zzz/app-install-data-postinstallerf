Comment3='
DataClone does data cloning, i.e. copies things recursively. This is
smart so that it works with not only non-blessed references, but also
with blessed references (i.e. objects). When clone() finds an object, it
calls a clone method of the object if the object has a clone, otherwise
it makes a surface copy of the object. That is, this module does
polymorphic data cloning.

Neko is a high-level dynamically typed programming language which can
also be used as an embedded scripting language. It has been designed
to provide a common runtime for several different languages. Neko is
not only very easy to learn and use, but also has the flexibility of
being able to extend the language with C libraries. You can even write
generators from your own language to Neko and then use the Neko
Runtime to compile, run, and access existing libraries.

If you need to add a scripting language to your application, Neko
provides one of the best tradeoffs available between simplicity,

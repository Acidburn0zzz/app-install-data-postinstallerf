Provides a quick and easy way to replace any text on a site.

Features
* Easily replace anything thats passed through t()
* Locale support, allowing you to override strings in any language
* Ability to import/export *.po files, for easy migration from the Locale module
* Note that this is not a replacement to Locale as having thousands of overrides
  can cause more pain then benefit. Use this only if you need a few easy text
  changes.

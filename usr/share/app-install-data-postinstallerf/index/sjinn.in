S-Jinn is a free, lightweight, open-source Linux application written in
C. It is a simple command-line tool designed for sending & receiving
data from PC controlled TIA/EIA-232 (RS-232) test, measurement,
and control devices.

Depending on your application you may be able to use stty or
C-Kermit, but I believe you will find that S-Jinn is easier-to-use,
more intuitive, and more concise in the area of command-line and/or
scripted RS-232 data acquisition and control.

TestMockObject is a highly polymorphic testing object, capable of
looking like all sorts of objects.  This makes white-box testing much
easier, as you can concentrate on what the code being tested sends to
and receives from the mocked object, instead of worrying about faking
up your own data.  (Another option is not to test difficult things.
Now you have no excuse.)

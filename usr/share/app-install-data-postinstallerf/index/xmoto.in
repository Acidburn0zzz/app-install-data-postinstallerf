X-Moto is a challenging 2D motocross platform game, where physics play an all
important role in the gameplay. You need to control your bike to its limit, if
you want to have a chance finishing the more difficult of the challenges.

First youll try just to complete the levels, while later youll compete with
yourself and others, racing against the clock.

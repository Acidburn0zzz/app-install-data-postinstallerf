MAME stands for Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator.  When used in conjunction
with an arcade games data files (ROMs), MAME will more or less faithfully
reproduce that game on a PC.

The ROM images that MAME utilizes are "dumped" from arcade games original
circuit-board ROM chips.  MAME becomes the "hardware" for the games, taking
the place of their original CPUs and support chips.  Therefore, these games
are NOT simulations, but the actual, original games that appeared in arcades.
MAMEs purpose is to preserve these decades of video-game history.  As gaming

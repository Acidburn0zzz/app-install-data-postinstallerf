lzop is a compression utility which is designed to be a companion to gzip.
It is based on the LZO data compression library and its main advantages over
gzip are much higher compression and decompression speed at the cost of some
compression ratio. The lzop compression utility was designed with the goals
of reliability, speed, portability and with reasonable drop-in compatibility
to gzip.

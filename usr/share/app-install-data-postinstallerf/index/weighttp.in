weighttp (pronounced weighty) is a lightweight and small benchmarking tool for
webservers.

It was designed to be very fast and easy to use and only supports a tiny
fraction of the HTTP protocol in order to be lean and simple.
weighttp supports multithreading to make good use of modern CPUs with multiple
cores as well as asynchronous i/o for concurrent requests within a single
thread.

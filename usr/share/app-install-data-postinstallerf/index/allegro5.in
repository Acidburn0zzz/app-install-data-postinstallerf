Allegro is a cross-platform library intended for use in computer games
and other types of multimedia programming. Allegro 5 is the latest major
revision of the library, designed to take advantage of modern hardware
(e.g. hardware acceleration using 3D cards) and operating systems.
Although it is not backwards compatible with earlier versions, it still
occupies the same niche and retains a familiar style.

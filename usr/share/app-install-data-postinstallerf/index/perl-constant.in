Comment3='
This pragma allows you to declare constants at compile-time

use constant PI => 4 * atan2(1, 1);
When you declare a constant such as "PI" using the method shown above,
each machine your script runs upon can have as many digits of accuracy
as it can use. Also, your program will be easier to read, more likely
to be maintained (and maintained correctly), and far less likely to
send a space probe to the wrong planet because nobody noticed the one
equation in which you wrote 3.14195.

Comment='<span size="xx-large">A humanist sans serif font</span>'
Comment3='
Designed by Caroline Hadilaksono, inspired by her favorite humanist
sans serif typefaces. It has the hand drawn and human qualities of a
serif, and still retains the clarity and efficiencies of a sans serif
typeface. It combines the best of both worlds.

Old style and lining figures are included.

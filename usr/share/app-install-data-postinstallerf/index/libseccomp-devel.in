The libseccomp library provides an easy to use interface to the Linux Kernels
syscall filtering mechanism, seccomp.  The libseccomp API allows an application
to specify which syscalls, and optionally which syscall arguments, the
application is allowed to execute, all of which are enforced by the Linux
Kernel.

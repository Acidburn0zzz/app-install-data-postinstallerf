Comment3='
dhcp-fwd forwards DHCP messages between subnets with different sublayer
broadcast domains. It is similar to the DHCP relay agent dhcrelay of
ISCs DHCP, but has the following important features

* Runs as non-root in a chroot-environment
* Uses AF_INET sockets which makes it possible to filter incoming
  messages with packetfilters
* The DHCP agent IDs can be defined freely
* Has a small memory footprint when using dietlibc

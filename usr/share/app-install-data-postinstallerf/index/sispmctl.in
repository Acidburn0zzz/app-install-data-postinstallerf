The sispmctl tool can control Gembird SIS-PM Silver Shield programmable
power outlet strips (also known under the name Revolt Intelli-Plug)
from the command line.

It can be used to switch on or off any of the programmable power sockets of
the SIS-PM via USB. It can also show the current status of each power socket,
and it can handle multiple SIS-PM devices, too.

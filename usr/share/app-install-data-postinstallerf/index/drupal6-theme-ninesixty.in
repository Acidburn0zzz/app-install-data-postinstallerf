This theme is based on the 960 Grid System by Nathan Smith.  NineSixty
is a base theme with all the files provided by the 960 Grid System.
From the sketch sheets to all the styles from the framework are
included. There are a few modifications so it better fits into
Drupal. All the details are inside the README.txt file.

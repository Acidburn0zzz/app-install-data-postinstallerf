Many software projects are mirrored worldwide. The mirror sites are required
to update the mirror archive regularly (daily, weekly) from a root server.

Mirmon helps administrators in keeping an eye on the mirror sites. In a
concise graphic format, mirmon shows each sites status history of the
last two weeks. It is easy to spot stale or dead mirrors.

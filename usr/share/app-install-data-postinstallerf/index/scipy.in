Scipy is open-source software for mathematics, science, and
engineering. The core library is NumPy which provides convenient and
fast N-dimensional array manipulation. The SciPy library is built to
work with NumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient
numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration and
optimization. Together, they run on all popular operating systems, are
quick to install, and are free of charge. NumPy and SciPy are easy to
use, but powerful enough to be depended upon by some of the worlds
leading scientists and engineers.

NorduGrid is a collaboration aiming at development, maintenance and
support of the free Grid middleware, known as the Advanced Resource
Connector (ARC).

Index server component of the ARC Cache Index (ACIX), usually installed
independently of any A-REX installation. This component pulls cache content
from cache servers and can be queried by clients for the location of cached
files.

Comment3='
Provides a set of daemons to manage access to remote directories and
authentication mechanisms. It provides an NSS and PAM interface toward
the system and a pluggable backend system to connect to multiple different
account sources. It is also the basis to provide client auditing and policy
services for projects like FreeIPA.

The sssd subpackage is a meta-package that contains the deamon as well as all
the existing back ends.

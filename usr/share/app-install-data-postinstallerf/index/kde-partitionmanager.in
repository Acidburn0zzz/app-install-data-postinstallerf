KDE Partition Manager is a utility program to help you manage the disk devices,
partitions and file systems on your computer. It allows you to easily create,
copy, move, delete, resize without losing data, backup and restore partitions.

KDE Partition Manager supports a large number of file systems,
including ext2/3/4, reiserfs, NTFS, FAT16/32, jfs, xfs and more.
It makes use of external programs to get its job done, so you might have to
install additional software (preferably packages from your distribution)
to make use of all features and get full support for all file systems.

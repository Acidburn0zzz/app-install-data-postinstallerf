YubiKey is a secure method for logging into many websites using a
cryptographically secure USB token. It does not require special
software, and since it does not generate the same OTP (One Time
Password) more than once, nothing is shared among associated sites.
Users can assign one or more YubiKeys to an existing account, and
log in using a YubiKey. This offers additional security to the users
even over insecure connections.

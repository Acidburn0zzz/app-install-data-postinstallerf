Tetrinetx is the GNU TetriNET server written in C. It includes IRC and
Spectator supports. As many other tetrinet servers, it uses IP independent
decryption which allows the server to run behind a router.

TetriNET is a network-based, multiplayer falling bricks game. This package
contains a server for hosting TetriNET games over a public or private network.

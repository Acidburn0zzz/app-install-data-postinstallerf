Comment3='
Qt Quick is a collection of technologies that are designed to help
developers create the kind of intuitive, modern, fluid user interfaces
that are increasingly used on mobile phones, media players, set-top
boxes and other portable devices.

Qt Quick consists of a rich set of user interface elements, a declarative
language for describing user interfaces and a language runtime. A
collection of C++ APIs is used to integrate these high level features
with classic Qt applications.

GStreamer is a streaming-media framework, based on graphs of filters
which operate on media data. Applications using this library can do
anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
about anything else media-related. Its plug-in-based architecture
means that new data types or processing capabilities can be added by
installing new plug-ins.

Gofer provides an extensible, light weight, universal python agent.
The gofer core agent is a python daemon (service) that provides
infrastructure for exposing a remote API and for running Recurring
Actions. The APIs contributed by plug-ins are accessible by Remote
Method Invocation (RMI). The transport for RMI is AMQP using the
QPID message broker. Actions are also provided by plug-ins and are
executed at the specified interval.

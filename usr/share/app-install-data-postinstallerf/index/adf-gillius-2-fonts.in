The Gillius family from the Arkandis Digital Foundry is a set of sans-serif
typefaces intended as an alternative to Gill Sans. Its two widths, regular and
condensed, both feature a roman and an italic, and each includes a regular and
bold weight.
A slightly rounder variant, which features the same set of weights,
widths, and slopes.

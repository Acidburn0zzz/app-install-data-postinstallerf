This package provides macros and an environment to generate
timing diagrams (digital waveforms) without much effort. The
TikZ package is used to produce the graphics. The diagrams may
be inserted into text (paragraphs, \hbox, etc.) and into
tikzpictures. A tabular-like environment is provided to produce
larger timing diagrams.

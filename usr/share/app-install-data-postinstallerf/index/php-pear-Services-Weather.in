Services_Weather searches for given locations and retrieves current
weather data and, dependent on the used service, also forecasts.
Up to now, GlobalWeather from CapeScience, Weather XML from EJSE (US
only), a XOAP service from Weather.com and METAR/TAF from NOAA are
supported. Further services will get included, if they become available,
have a usable API and are properly documented.

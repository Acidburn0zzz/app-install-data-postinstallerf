Comment3='
This software is an implementation of the Precision Time Protocol (PTP)
according to IEEE standard 1588 for Linux. The dual design goals are to provide
a robust implementation of the standard and to use the most relevant and modern
Application Programming Interfaces (API) offered by the Linux kernel.
Supporting legacy APIs and other platforms is not a goal.

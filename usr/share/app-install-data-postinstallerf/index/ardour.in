Ardour is a multichannel hard disk recorder (HDR) and digital audio workstation
(DAW). It is capable of simultaneous recording 24 or more channels of 32 bit
audio at 48kHz. Ardour is intended to function as a "professional" HDR system,
replacing dedicated hardware solutions such as the Mackie HDR, the Tascam 2424

intended to provide the same or better functionality as software systems such
as ProTools, Samplitude, Logic Audio, Nuendo and Cubase VST (we acknowledge
these and all other names as trademarks of their respective owners). It
supports MIDI Machine Control, and so can be controlled from any MMC
controller, such as the Mackie Digital 8 Bus mixer and many other modern

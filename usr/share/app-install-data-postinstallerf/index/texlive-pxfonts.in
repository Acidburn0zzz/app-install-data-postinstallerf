Pxfonts supplies virtual text roman fonts using Adobe Palatino
(or URWPalladioL) with some modified and additional text
symbols in the OT1, T1, and TS1 encodings; maths alphabets
using Palatino/Palladio; maths fonts providing all the symbols
of the Computer Modern and AMS fonts, including all the Greek
capital letters from CMR; and additional maths fonts of various
other symbols. The set is complemented by a sans-serif set of
text fonts, based on Helvetica/NimbusSanL, and a monospace set
derived from the parallel TX font set. All the fonts are in

This package provides a LaTeX2e document class named ua-
thesis for typesetting theses and dissertations in the
official format required by the University of Arizona.
Moreover, there is a fully compatible alternative document
class my-thesis for private nice copies of the
dissertation, and the respective title pages are available as
separate packages to work with any document class.

GOCR is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) program, developed under the
GNU Public License. It converts scanned images of text back to text files.
Joerg Schulenburg started the program, and now leads a team of developers.

GOCR can be used with different front-ends, which makes it very easy to port
to different OSes and architectures. It can open many different image
formats, and its quality have been improving in a daily basis.

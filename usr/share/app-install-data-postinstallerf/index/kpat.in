A selection of solitaire card games.
To play patience you need, as the name suggests, patience. For simple
games, where the way the game goes depends only upon how the cards fall,
your patience might be the only thing you need.  There are also patience
games where you must plan your strategy and think ahead in order to win.
A theme common to all the games is the player must put the cards in a
special order ? moving, turning and reordering them.

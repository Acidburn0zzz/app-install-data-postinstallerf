Comment3='
Developers hate writing documentation.  Theyd hate it even more if their
computer tattled on them, but maybe theyll be even more thankful in the
long run.  Even if not, perlmodstyle tells you to, so you must obey.

This module provides a mechanism for determining if the pod for a given
module is comprehensive.

Libcmpiutil is a library of utility functions for CMPI providers.
The goal is to reduce the amount of repetitive work done in
most CMPI providers by encapsulating common procedures with more
"normal" APIs.  This extends from operations like getting typed
instance properties to standardizing method dispatch and argument checking.

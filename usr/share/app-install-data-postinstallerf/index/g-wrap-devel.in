Comment3='
g-wrap-devel contains development libraries and headers for g-wrap.

You can provide access to a given C API by creating a specification
file describing the interface you want published at the Scheme level.
g-wrap will handle generating all the lower level library interface
code so that the C library shows up as a set of Scheme functions.
You should install g-wrap-devel if you need to compile programs that
need to use g-wrap C<->Scheme functionality

The ppp package contains the PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) daemon and
documentation for PPP support. The PPP protocol provides a method for
transmitting datagrams over serial point-to-point links. PPP is
usually used to dial in to an ISP (Internet Service Provider) or other
organization over a modem and phone line.

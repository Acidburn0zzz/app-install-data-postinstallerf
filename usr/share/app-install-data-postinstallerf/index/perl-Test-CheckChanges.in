This module checks that your Changes file has an entry for the current version
of the Module being tested. The version information for the distribution being
tested is taken out of the Build data, or if that is not found, out of the
Makefile. It then attempts to open, in order, a file with the name Changes or
CHANGES. The Changes file is then parsed for version numbers. If one and only
one of the version numbers matches, the test passes; otherwise the test fails.
A message with the current version is printed if the test passes; otherwise
diagnostic messages are printed to help explain the failure.

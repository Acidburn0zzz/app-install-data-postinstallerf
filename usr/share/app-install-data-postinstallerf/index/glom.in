Glom lets you design database systems - the database and the user
interface. Glom has high-level features such as relationships,
lookups, related fields, related records, calculated fields, drop-down
choices, searching, reports, users and groups. It has Numeric, Text,
Date, Time, Boolean, and Image field types. Glom systems require
almost no programming, but you may use Python for calculated fields or
buttons. Glom uses the PostgreSQL database backend.

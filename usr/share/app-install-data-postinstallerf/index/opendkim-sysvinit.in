Comment3='
OpenDKIM allows signing and/or verification of email through an open source
library that implements the DKIM service, plus a milter-based filter
application that can plug in to any milter-aware MTA, including sendmail,
Postfix, or any other MTA that supports the milter protocol. This package
contains the SysV init script to manage the OpenDKIM milter when running a
legacy SysV-compatible init system.

It is not required when the init system used is systemd.

Firewall Builder consists of a GUI and set of policy compilers for
various firewall platforms. It helps users maintain a database of
objects and allows policy editing using simple drag-and-drop
operations. GUI generates firewall description in the form of XML
file, which compilers then interpret and generate platform-specific
code. Several algorithms are provided for automated network objects
discovery and bulk import of data. The GUI and policy compilers are
completely independent, this provides for a consistent abstract model
and the same GUI for different firewall platforms.

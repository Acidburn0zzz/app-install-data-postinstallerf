Tired of comment spam, form spam and dumb crawlers? A django application that
provides middleware for blocking IPs listed in stopforumspam.coms database. A
simple management command is provided for updating the database

Using this command, all IPs are stored in Django models. Using django-admin,
its possible to add your own extra IP addresses on a permanent database.

Enumerators are an efficient, predictable, and safe alternative to lazy I/O.
Discovered by Oleg Kiselyov, they allow large datasets to be processed
in near-constant space by pure code. Although somewhat more complex to write,
using enumerators instead of lazy I/O produces more correct programs.

This library contains an enumerator implementation for Haskell, designed to
be both simple and efficient. Three core types are defined, along with
numerous helper functions
* /Iteratee/ Data sinks, analogous to left folds. Iteratees consume

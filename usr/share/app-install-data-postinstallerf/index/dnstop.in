dnstop is a libpcap application (ala tcpdump) that displays various
tables of DNS traffic on your network.

dnstop supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
To help find especially undesirable DNS queries, dnstop provides a
number of filters.
dnstop can either read packets from the live capture device, or from a
tcpdump savefile.

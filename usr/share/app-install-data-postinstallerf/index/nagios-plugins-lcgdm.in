Comment3='
This package provides the nagios probes for LCGDM components (DPM and LFC) that
need to be run remotely. Usually they are installed in the nagios host, and
they will contact the remote services running in the DPM and LFC hosts.

The Disk Pool Manager (DPM) is a lightweight grid storage component, allowing
access to data using commonly used grid protocols. The LCG File Catalog (LFC)
is the main catalog being used by grid communities for both file bookkeeping
and meta-data.

Comment3='
Provides auto blacklisting of hosts and users responsible for repeated
failed authentication attempts. Generally configured so that
blacklisted users still see normal login prompts but are guaranteed to
fail to authenticate. A command line tool allows to query or purge the
databases used by the pam_abl module.

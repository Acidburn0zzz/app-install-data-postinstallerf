Xgridfit is a high-level, XML-based language for gridfitting, or ?hinting?,
fonts. The Xgridfit program compiles an XML source file into tables and
instructions that relate to the gridfitting of glyphs. Xgridfit does not
insert these elements into a font itself, but rather relies on FontForge, the
Open-Source font editor, to do so.

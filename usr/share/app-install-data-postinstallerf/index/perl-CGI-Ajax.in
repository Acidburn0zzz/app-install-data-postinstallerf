CGIAjax is an object-oriented module that provides a unique mechanism for
using perl code asynchronously from javascript- enhanced HTML pages.
CGIAjax unburdens the user from having to write extensive javascript,
except for associating an exported method with a document-defined event
(such as onClick, onKeyUp, etc). CGIAjax also mixes well with HTML
containing more complex javascript.

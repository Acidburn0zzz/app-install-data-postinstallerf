Comment3='
The arptables_jf utility controls the arpfilter network packet filtering
code in the Linux kernel.  You do not need this program for normal
network firewalling.  If you need to manually control which arp
requests and/or replies this machine accepts and sends, you should
install this package.

Arptables_jf is a fork of arptables from ebtables.sourceforge.net

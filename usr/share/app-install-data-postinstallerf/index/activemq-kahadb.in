A file based persistence database that is local to the message broker that
is using it. It has been optimized for fast persistence and is the the default
storage mechanism from ActiveMQ 5.4 onwards. KahaDB uses less file descriptors
and provides faster recovery than its predecessor, the AMQ Message Store.

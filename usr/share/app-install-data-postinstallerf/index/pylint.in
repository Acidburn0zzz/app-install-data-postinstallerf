Pylint is a python tool that checks if a module satisfy a coding standard.
Pylint can be seen as another PyChecker since nearly all tests you can do
with PyChecker can also be done with Pylint. But Pylint offers some more
features, like checking line-codes length, checking if variable names are
well-formed according to your coding standard, or checking if declared
interfaces are truly implemented, and much more. The big advantage with
Pylint is that it is highly configurable, customizable, and you can easily
write a small plugin to add a personal feature.

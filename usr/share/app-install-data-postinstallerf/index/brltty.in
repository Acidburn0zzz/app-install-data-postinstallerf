BRLTTY is a background process (daemon) which provides
access to the Linux/Unix console (when in text mode)
for a blind person using a refreshable braille display.
It drives the braille display and provides complete
screen review functionality.

BRLTTY can also work with speech synthesizers; if you want to use it with
Speech Dispatcher, please install also package brltty-speech-dispatcher.

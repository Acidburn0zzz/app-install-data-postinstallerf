This is version 1.12 of ApacheAuthDBI and ApacheDBI.

These modules are supposed to be used with the Apache server together with
an embedded perl interpreter like mod_perl. They provide support for basic
authentication and authorization as well as support for persistent database
connections via Perls Database Independent Interface (DBI).

Source-highlight-qt is a library for performing syntax highlighting in
Qt documents by relying on GNU Source-Highlight library.

Although the use of GNU Source-highlight library is pretty hidden by
this library, so the programmer must not need the details of GNU
Source-highlight library, yet, some general notions of GNU
Source-highlight might be useful.

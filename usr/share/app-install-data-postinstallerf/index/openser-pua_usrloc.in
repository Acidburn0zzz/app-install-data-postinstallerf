This module is the connector between usrloc and pua modules. It creates the
environment to send PUBLISH requests for user location records, on specific
events (e.g., when new record is added in usrloc, a PUBLISH with status open
(online) is issued; when expires, it sends closed (offline)). Using this
module, phones which have no support for presence can be seen as
online/offline.

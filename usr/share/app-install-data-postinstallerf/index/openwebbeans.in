Comment3='
OpenWebBeans is an implementation of the JSR-299, Contexts and
Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform.

It also already incorporates some features which are part of JSR-346
but doesnt need API changes as we still use the JCDI-1.0 API. The
incorporated CDI-1.1 features are mostly parts which are not well defined
in the CDI-1.0 specification, like Serialisation checks, etc.

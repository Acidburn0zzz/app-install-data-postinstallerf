Comment3='
This module is a direct subclass of TAPHarness and behaves in exactly the
same way except for one detail. In addition to outputting a running progress
of the tests and an ending summary it can also capture all of the raw TAP
from the individual test files or streams into an archive file (.tar or
.tar.gz).

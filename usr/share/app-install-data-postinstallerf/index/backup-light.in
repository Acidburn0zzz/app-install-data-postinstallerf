Backup-light is a small, lightweight utility written for the bash shell
that backups the active users $HOME directory. Backup-light is able to
preform both full and incremental backups with the options to preform a
backup with out updating the time stamp, or to backup to a different
directory or device at will. Backup-light also creates MD5sums of the
backup archives for added security.

libdnet provides a simplified, portable interface to several
low-level networking routines, including network address
manipulation, kernel arp(4) cache and route(4) table lookup and
manipulation, network firewalling (IP filter, ipfw, ipchains,
pf, ...), network interface lookup and manipulation, raw IP
packet and Ethernet frame, and data transmission.

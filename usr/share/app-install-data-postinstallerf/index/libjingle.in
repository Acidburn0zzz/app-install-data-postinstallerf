Libjingle is Google Talks implementation of Jingle and Jingle-Audio
(proposed extensions to XMPP) to interoperate with Google Talks
peer-to-peer and voice calling capabilities.

In addition, it is a P2P (peer-to-peer) and RTC (real-time communication)
stack that builds on XMPP. If you dont need any P2P or RTC, you can use any
XMPP stack. If you do, then you might want to use libjingle. In fact, you
can even use libjingle on top of another XMPP stack.

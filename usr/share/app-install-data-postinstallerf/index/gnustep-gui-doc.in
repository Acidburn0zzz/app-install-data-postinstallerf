The GNUstep GUI library is a library of graphical user interface classes
written completely in the Objective-C language; the classes are based
upon the OpenStep specification as release by NeXT Software, Inc.  These
classes include graphical objects such as buttons, text fields, popup
lists, browser lists, and windows; there are also many associated
classes for handling events, colors, fonts, pasteboards and images.

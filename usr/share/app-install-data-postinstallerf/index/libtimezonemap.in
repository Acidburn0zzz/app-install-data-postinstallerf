Comment3='
libtimezonemap is a time zone map widget for Gtk+. The widget displays a world
map with a highlighted region representing the selected time zone, and the
location can be changed by clicking on the map.

This library is a fork of the of the code from gnome-control-centers datetime
panel, which was itself a fork of Ubiquitys timezone map.

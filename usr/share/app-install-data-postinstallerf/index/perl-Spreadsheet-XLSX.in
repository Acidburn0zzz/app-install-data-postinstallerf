The SpreadsheetXLSX module is a emulation of SpreadsheetParseExcel for
Excel 2007 (.xlsx) file format in a quick and dirty way. It supports styles
and many of the Excels quirks, but not all. It populates the classes from
SpreadsheetParseExcel for interoperability; including workbook, worksheet
and cell.

Comment3='
The DigestSHA1 module allows you to use the NIST SHA-1 message
digest algorithm from within Perl programs. The algorithm takes as
input a message of arbitrary length and produces as output a 160-bit
"fingerprint" or "message digest" of the input.

The DigestSHA1 module provide a procedural interface for simple use,
as well as an object oriented interface that can handle messages of
arbitrary length and which can read files directly.
A binary digest will be 20 bytes long. A hex digest will be 40

The Avalon framework consists of interfaces that define relationships
between commonly used application components, best-of-practice pattern
enforcements, and several lightweight convenience implementations of the
generic components.
What that means is that we define the central interface Component. We
also define the relationship (contract) a component has with peers,
ancestors and children.

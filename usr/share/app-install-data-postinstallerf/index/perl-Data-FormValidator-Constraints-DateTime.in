Comment3='
This package provides constraint routines for DataFormValidator for
dealing with dates and times. It provides an easy mechanism for validating
dates of any format (using strptime(3)) and transforming those dates (as
long as you untaint the fields) into valid DateTime objects, or into
strings that would be properly formatted for various database engines.

Dk-bib is a translation of the four standard BibTeX style files
(abbrv, alpha, plain and unsrt) and the apalike style file into
Danish. The files have been extended with URL, ISBN, ISSN,
annote and printing fields which can be enabled through a LaTeX
style file. Dk-bib also comes with a couple of Danish sorting
order files for BibTeX8.

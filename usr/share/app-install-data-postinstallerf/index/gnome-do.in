GNOME Do (Do) is an intelligent launcher tool that makes performing
common tasks on your computer simple and efficient. Do not only allows
you to search for items in your desktop environment
(e.g. applications, contacts, bookmarks, files, music), it also allows
you to specify actions to perform on search results (e.g. run, open,
email, chat, play).

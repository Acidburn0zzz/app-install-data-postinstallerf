CrossReport is a tool to help you analyze the APIs used by a compiled
Linux program, in order to work out the effort required to
cross-compile that program for Windows, using the Fedora MinGW
cross-compiler.

The simplest way to use it is to point it at an existing Linux binary,
and then read the generated report.
What it does in more detail It looks at the libraries and API calls
used by the Linux binary, and compares them to the libraries and API

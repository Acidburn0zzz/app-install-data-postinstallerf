Comment3='
Desktop Independent Alt-Tab window switcher from Razor-qt,
it was written for Razor-qt but it can be used standalone as well.
This application switcher supplements or replaces native window
manager (if available) so it should be enabled in config first.
This package is part of the Razor-qt.

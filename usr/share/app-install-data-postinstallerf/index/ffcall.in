Comment3='
This is a collection of four libraries which can be used to build
foreign function call interfaces in embedded interpreters.  The four
packages are
 - avcall calling C functions with variable arguments
 - vacall C functions accepting variable argument prototypes
 - trampoline closures as first-class C functions
 - callback closures with variable arguments as first-class C functions
   (a reentrant combination of vacall and trampoline)

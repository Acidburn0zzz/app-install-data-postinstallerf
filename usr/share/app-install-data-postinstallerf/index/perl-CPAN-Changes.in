It is standard practice to include a Changes file in your distribution. The
purpose of the Changes file is to help a user figure out what has changed
since the last release.

People have devised many ways to write the Changes file. A preliminary
specification has been created (CPANChangesSpec) to encourage module
authors to write clear and concise Changes.
This module will help users programmatically read and write Changes files
that conform to the specification.

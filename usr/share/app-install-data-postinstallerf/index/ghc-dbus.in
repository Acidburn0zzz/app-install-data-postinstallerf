Comment3='
D-Bus is a simple, message-based protocol for inter-process communication,
which allows applications to interact with other parts of the machine and the
users session using remote procedure calls.

This library is an implementation of the D-Bus protocol in Haskell. It can be
used to add D-Bus support to Haskell applications, without the awkward
interfaces common to foreign bindings.

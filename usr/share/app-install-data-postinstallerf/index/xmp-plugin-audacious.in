Libxmp is a library that renders module files to PCM data. It supports

Scream Tracker 3 (S3M), Fast Tracker II (XM), and Impulse Tracker (IT).

Many compressed module formats are supported, including popular Unix, DOS,
and Amiga file packers including gzip, bzip2, SQSH, PowerPacker, etc.
This package contains the xmp plugin for the Audacious media player.

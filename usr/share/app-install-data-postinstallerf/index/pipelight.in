Comment3='
Pipelight is a NPAPI wrapper plugin for using Windows plugins in Linux
browsers and therefore giving you the possibility to access services
which are otherwise not available for Linux users.  Typical examples of
such services are Netflix and Amazon Instant, which both use the
proprietary browser plugin Silverlight.  These services cannot normally
be used on Linux since this plugin is only available for Windows.

Pipelight helps you access these services by using the original
Silverlight plugin directly in your browser, all while giving you a
better hardware acceleration and performance than a virtual machine.

The traits package developed by Enthought provides a special type
definition called a trait. Although they can be used as normal Python object
attributes, traits also have several additional characteristics

* Initialization A trait can be assigned a default value.
* Validation A trait attributes type can be explicitly declared.
* Delegation The value of a trait attribute can be contained either
  in another object.
* Notification Setting the value of a trait attribute can trigger
  notification of other parts of the program.

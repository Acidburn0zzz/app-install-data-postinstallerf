sucrack is a multithreaded Linux/UNIX tool for brute-force cracking local user
accounts via su. This tool comes in handy as final instance on a system where
you have not to many privileges but you are in the wheel group. Many su
implementations require a pseudo terminal to be attached in order to take the
password from the user. This is why you couldnt just use a simple shell script
to do this work. This tool, written in c, is highly efficient and can attempt
multiple logins at the same time. Please be advised that using this tool will
take a lot of the CPU performance and fill up the logs quite quickly.

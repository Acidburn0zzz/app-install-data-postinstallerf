JOrtho is a spell checker for Java. The library works with any
JTextComponent from the Swing framework and checks as you type.
The dictionary is based on the free Wiktionary.org, and is
applicable for multiple languages. You can select the
spell checking language via a context menu. The features
of JOrtho are the highlighting of potentially wrongly spelled words,
a context menu with suggestions for correct forms of the word
and a context menu with option to change the checking language.
At the moment there are eight languages for spell checking available
English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Polish, and Arabic.

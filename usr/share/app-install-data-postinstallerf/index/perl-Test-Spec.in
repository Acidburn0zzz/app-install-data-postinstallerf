Comment3='
This is a declarative specification-style testing system for behavior-driven
development (BDD) in Perl. The tests (a.k.a. examples) are named with strings
instead of subroutine names, so your fingers will suffer less fatigue from
underscore-itis, with the side benefit that the test reports are more legible.

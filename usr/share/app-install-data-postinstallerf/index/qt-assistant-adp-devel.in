Comment3='
This package contains the files necessary to build applications using the
deprecated QAssistantClient class (in the deprecated QtAssistantClient library),
which is used together with the legacy Assistant Document Profile (.adp) version
of Qt Assistant.

This class is obsolete. It is provided to keep old source code working. We
strongly advise against using it in new code. New code should use the Qt Help
Framework introduced in Qt 4.4 and/or the version of Qt Assistant based on it
(also introduced in Qt 4.4) instead.

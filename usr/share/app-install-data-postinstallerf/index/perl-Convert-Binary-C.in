Comment3='
ConvertBinaryC is a preprocessor and parser for C type definitions. It
is highly configurable and supports arbitrarily complex data structures.
Its object-oriented interface has pack and unpack methods that act as
replacements for Perls pack and unpack and allow to use C types instead of
a string representation of the data structure for conversion of binary data
from and to Perls complex data structures.

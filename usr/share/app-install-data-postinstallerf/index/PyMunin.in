Python Module for developing Munin Multigraph Monitoring Plugins.

Regular Munin Plugins employ one-plugin one-graph logic and require the
execution of a script for data retrieval for each graph. Multigraph plugins
permit retrieval of data for multiple graphs in one execution run
(one-plugin many-graphs), reducing the processing time and delay for the
fetch cycle significantly.

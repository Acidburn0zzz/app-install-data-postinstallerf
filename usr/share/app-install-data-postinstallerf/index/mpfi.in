Comment3='
MPFI is intended to be a portable library written in C for arbitrary
precision interval arithmetic with intervals represented using MPFR
reliable floating-point numbers. It is based on the GNU MP library and
on the MPFR library and is part of the latter. The purpose of an
arbitrary precision interval arithmetic is on the one hand to get
"guaranteed" results, thanks to interval computation, and on the other
hand to obtain accurate results, thanks to multiple precision
arithmetic. The MPFI library is built upon MPFR in order to benefit
from the correct roundings provided by MPFR. Further advantages of
using MPFR are its portability and compliance with the IEEE 754

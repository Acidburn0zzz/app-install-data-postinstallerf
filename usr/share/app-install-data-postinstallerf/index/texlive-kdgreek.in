The fonts are distributed as MetaFont source; the design
derives from Silvio Levy?s fonts, but has also been
influenced by Yannis Haralambous? work. They are 8-bit fonts
which, the author believes, leads to more robust macro
programming. Both ancient and modern Greek are supported.
Macros to work with Plain TeX (?greektex?) and with LaTeX
2.09 (?grlatex?) are provided.

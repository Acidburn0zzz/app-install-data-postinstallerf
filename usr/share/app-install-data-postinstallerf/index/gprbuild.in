GPRbuild is an advanced software tool designed to help automate
the construction of multi-language systems.
It removes complexity from multi-language development by allowing
developers to quickly and easily compile and link software written
in a combination of languages including Ada, Assembler, C, C++, and Fortran.
Easily extendable by users to cover new toolchains and languages
it is primarily aimed at projects of all sizes organized into subsystems
and libraries and is particularly well-suited for compiled languages.

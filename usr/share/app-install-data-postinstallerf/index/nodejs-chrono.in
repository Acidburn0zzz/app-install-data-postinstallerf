Allows formatting of time in a `strftime` style, but with syntax taken
from PHPs date function. It implements pretty much all of the tokens
from PHPs date function, except for B (Swatch internet time) and
e (Content/City timezone identifier). You can escape characters with
a `\` (remember to encode the `\` in a string as well). All other
characters will be printed as they appear in the format string.

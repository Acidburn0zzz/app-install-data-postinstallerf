Moose, a powerful metaobject-fueled extension of the Perl 5 object system,
is wonderful.  (For more information on Moose, please see perldoc Moose
after installing the perl-Moose package.)

Unfortunately, its a little slow. Though significant progress has been
made over the years, the compile time penalty is a non-starter for some
applications.  Mouse aims to alleviate this by providing a subset of Mooses
functionality, faster.

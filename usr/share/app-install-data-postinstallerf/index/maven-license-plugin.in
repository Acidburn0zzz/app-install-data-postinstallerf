maven-license-plugin is a Maven plugin that help you managing license
headers in source files. Basically, when you are developing a project
either in open source or in a company, you often need to add at the top
of your source files a license to protect your work.
This plugin lets you maintain the headers, including checking if the
header is present, generating a report and of course having the
possibility to update / reformat missing license headers.

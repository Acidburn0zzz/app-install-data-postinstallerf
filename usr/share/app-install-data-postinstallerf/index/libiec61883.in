Comment3='
The libiec61883 library provides an higher level API for streaming DV,
MPEG-2 and audio over IEEE1394.  Based on the libraw1394 isochronous
functionality, this library acts as a filter that accepts DV-frames,
MPEG-2 frames or audio samples from the application and breaks these
down to isochronous packets, which are transmitted using libraw1394.

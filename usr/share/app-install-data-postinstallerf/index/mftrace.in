Comment3='
mftrace is a small Python program that lets you trace a TeX bitmap
font into a PFA or PFB font (A PostScript Type1 Scalable Font) or TTF
(TrueType) font.

Scalable fonts offer many advantages over bitmaps, as they allow
documents to render correctly at many printer resolutions. Moreover,
Ghostscript can generate much better PDF, if given scalable PostScript
fonts.

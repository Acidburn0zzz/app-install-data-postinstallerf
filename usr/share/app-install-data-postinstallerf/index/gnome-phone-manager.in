This program will connect to your mobile phone over a serial port,
either via a cable, infrared (IrDA) or Bluetooth connection.

For example it listens for text messages, and when they arrive,
displays them on the desktop. A visual indicator is displayed in
the notification area, if one is presently added to the panel.

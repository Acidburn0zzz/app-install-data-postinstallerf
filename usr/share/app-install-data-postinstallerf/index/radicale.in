The Radicale Project is a CalDAV (calendar) and CardDAV (contact) server. It
aims to be a light solution, easy to use, easy to install, easy to configure.
As a consequence, it requires few software dependencies and is pre-configured
to work out-of-the-box.

The Radicale Project runs on most of the UNIX-like platforms (Linux, BSD,
MacOS X) and Windows. It is known to work with Evolution, Lightning, iPhone
and Android clients. It is free and open-source software, released under GPL
version 3.

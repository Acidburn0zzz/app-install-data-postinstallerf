Comment3='
Epylog is a new log notifier and parser which runs periodically out of
cron, looks at your logs, processes the entries in order to present
them in a more comprehensive format, and then provides you with the
output. It is written specifically with large network clusters in mind
where a lot of machines (around 50 and upwards) log to the same
loghost using syslog or syslog-ng.

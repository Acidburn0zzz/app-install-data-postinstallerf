Comment3='
This module is an AnyEvent user, you need to make sure that you use and
run a supported event loop.

This module implements a simple, stateless and non-blocking HTTP client.
It supports GET, POST and other request methods, cookies and more, all
on a very low level. It can follow redirects supports proxies and
automatically limits the number of connections to the values specified
in the RFC.
It should generally be a "good client" that is enough for most HTTP

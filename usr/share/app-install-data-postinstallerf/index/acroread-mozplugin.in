Acroread is a well known PDF viewer.

Adobe Reader is often the only program able to process complicated PDF
files, such as PDF forms. However, there are many bugs where we cannot
do anything about because it is proprietary binary-only software.
Please consider whether it is possible to use free PDF readers like
okular, evince, xpdf, ghostview, ... instead.

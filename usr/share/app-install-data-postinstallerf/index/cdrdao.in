Comment3='
Cdrdao records audio CD-Rs in disk-at-once (DAO) mode, based on a
textual description of the CD contents. Recording in DAO mode writes
the complete disc (lead-in, one or more tracks, and lead-out) in a
single step. DAO allows full control over the length and the contents
of pre-gaps, the pause areas between tracks.

The package enables the user to typeset exams with multiple
choice, open questions and many other types of exercise. Both
questions and answers may be randomly distributed within the
exam, and the solutions are typeset automatically. Exercises
may contain a wide number of random parameters and it is
possible to do arithmetical operations on them. The package is
localised in Italian, English, French, German, Greek and
Spanish.

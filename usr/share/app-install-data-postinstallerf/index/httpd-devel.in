The httpd-devel package contains the APXS binary and other files
that you need to build Dynamic Shared Objects (DSOs) for the
Apache HTTP Server.

If you are installing the Apache HTTP server and you want to be
able to compile or develop additional modules for Apache, you need
to install this package.

Comment3='
This single-purpose module attempts to eliminate uncaught syntax errors or
other obvious goofs in subroutines that are autosplit, and hence not looked
at by perl -c Module.pm. Ideally, this module will become unnecessary as
you reach full coverage of those subroutines in your unit tests. Until that
happy day, however, this should provide a quick and dirty backstop for
embarrassing typos.

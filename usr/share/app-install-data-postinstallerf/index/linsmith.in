linSmith is a Smith Charting program.
Its main features are
  * Definition of multiple load impedances
  * Addition of discrete and line components
  * A virtual component switches from impedance
    to admittance to help explaining parallel components
  * The chart works in real impedances
  * Load and circuit configuration is stored separately,
    permitting several solutions without re-defining the other

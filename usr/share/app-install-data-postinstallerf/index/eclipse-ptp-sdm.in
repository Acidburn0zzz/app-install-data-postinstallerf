Parallel Tools Platform components that implement a parallel debug server
using the Scalable Debug Manager (SDM).

NOTE The sdm binary for the architecture of the host machine is available
in the sdm plugin and at /usr/lib64/ptp/sdm.  If the target system is of
a different archicture, you will need to build and install it by hand.

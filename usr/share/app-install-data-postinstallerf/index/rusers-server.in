The rusers program allows users to find out who is logged into various
machines on the local network.  The rusers command produces output
similar to who, but for the specified list of hosts or for all
machines on the local network. The rusers-server package contains the
server for responding to rusers requests.

Install rusers-server if you want remote users to be able to see
who is logged into your machine.

Comment3='
Zarafa Webaccess features the familiar Outlook Look & Feel interface
and you can keep using the features in Outlook that have always allowed
you to work efficiently. View your e-mail, calendar and contacts via a
web browser. And opening your colleagues calendar or sending a meeting
request is only a piece of cake. The Zarafa Webaccess is using the ajax
technology to give a more interactive feeling to the users.

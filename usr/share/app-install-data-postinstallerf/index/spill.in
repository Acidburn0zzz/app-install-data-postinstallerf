spill is a program for creating set of symbolic links from one
directory hierarchy which point to corresponding file names in
a separate directory hierarchy. Its primary use is to allow
packages built from source to be installed in separate directory
trees, which are all linked together under a common directory
tree to reduce the length of the PATH environment variable.

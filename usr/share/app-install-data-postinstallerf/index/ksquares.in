Comment3='
The idea behind KSquares is to construct squares by interconnecting
the dots on the grid. Up to four players can play this game together,
taking turns. The trick is ? regardless of who has constructed most
of the square, it is the player who completes the square that gets the
point for it.
To win the game round player has to collect the most points by covering
the most area with the squares of players own color.

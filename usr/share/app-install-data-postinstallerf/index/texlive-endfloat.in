Comment3='
Place all floats on pages by themselves at the end of the
document, optionally leaving markers like "[Figure 3 about
here]" in the text near to where the figure (or table) would
normally have occurred. Float types figure and table are
recognised by the package, unmodified. Since several packages
define other types of float, it is possible to register these
float types with endfloat.

MonkeyStudio is a cross-platform Integrated Development Environment ( IDE )
aiming to become a Rapid Application Development ( RAD ) environment.
MonkeyStudio runs everywhere Qt 4.4.0 ( minimum required to build it )
is available as a shared library. It is extensible via a great and powerful
plug-in system which help make it do nearly anything you want and support
virtually any kind of project type for which a plug-in exists or is created.
The primary goal of MonkeyStudio was to manage Qt4 projects as best
as possible, it directly uses .pro files and does not create intrusive or
unsightly configuration files. MonkyStudio is also a multi language
code editor too ( JavaScript, XML, ... ).

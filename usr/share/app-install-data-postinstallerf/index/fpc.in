Comment3='

Free Pascal is a free 32/64bit Pascal Compiler. It comes with a run-time
library and is fully compatible with Turbo Pascal 7.0 and nearly Delphi
compatible. Some extensions are added to the language, like function
overloading and generics. Shared libraries can be linked. This package
contains command-line compiler and utils. Provided units are the runtime
library (RTL), free component library (FCL) and the base and extra packages.

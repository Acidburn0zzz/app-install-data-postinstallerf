LaTeX provides a mechanism for altering the appearance of
references to labels, but its somewhat flawed, and requires
that the user manipulate internal commands. The package fixes
the flaw in LaTeX, and provides a \labelformat command for
changing the format of references to labels. The package also
provides a \Ref command to make reference to such redefined
labels at the start of a sentence.

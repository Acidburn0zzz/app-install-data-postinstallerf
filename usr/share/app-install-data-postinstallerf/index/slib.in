Comment3='
"SLIB" is a portable library for the programming language Scheme.
It provides a platform independent framework for using "packages" of
Scheme procedures and syntax.  As distributed, SLIB contains useful
packages for all Scheme implementations.  Its catalog can be
transparently extended to accommodate packages specific to a site,
implementation, user, or directory.

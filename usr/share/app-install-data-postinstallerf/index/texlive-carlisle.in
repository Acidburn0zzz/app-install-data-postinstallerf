combining the capabilities of longtable and tabularx; - A
proforma for building personalised LaTeX formats; - A jiffy to
suppress page numbers; - An environment for including Plain TeX
in LaTeX documents; - A jiffy to remove counters from other

arbitrary sizes; - A jiffy to create slashed for physicists;

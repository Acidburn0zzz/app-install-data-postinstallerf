UNetbootin allows you to create bootable Live USB drives for a variety of
Linux distributions from Windows or Linux, without requiring you to burn a CD.
You can either let it download one of the many distributions supported
out-of-the-box for you, or supply your own Linux .iso file if youve already
downloaded one or your preferred distribution isnt on the list.

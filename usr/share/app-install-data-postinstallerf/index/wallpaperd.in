Wallpaperd is a small application that takes care of setting the background
image. Wallpaperd was created due to a friend requesting to have different
wallpapers on the different workspaces in Pekwm.

Wallpaperd now supports
* Changing wallpaper on workspace change.
* Changing wallpaper every X amount of time.
* Changing wallpaper based on a GNOME background.xml file.
* Support for specifying centered, zoomed, tiled and fill image modes.
* Selecting wallpaper based on workspace number.

Boto is a Python package that provides interfaces to Amazon Web Services.
It supports over thirty services, such as S3 (Simple Storage Service),
SQS (Simple Queue Service), and EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) via their
REST and Query APIs.  The goal of boto is to support the full breadth
and depth of Amazon Web Services.  In addition, boto provides support
for other public services such as Google Storage in addition to private
cloud systems like Eucalyptus, OpenStack and Open Nebula.

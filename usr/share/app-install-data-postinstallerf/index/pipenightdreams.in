PipeNightDreams is a puzzle-game where you must race against the clock to
connect the waterpipes to create a proper pipeline before the water starts
flowing. It has 25 levels with increasing difficulty, and you can create
your own by just editing text files. It has a lot of cool graphics, score,
lives, required pipes per level and an easy and fast interface.

Zend\ProgressBar is a component to create and update progress bars in different
environments. It consists of a single backend, which outputs the progress
through one of the multiple adapters. On every update, it takes an absolute
value and optionally a status message, and then calls the adapter with some
precalculated values like percentage and estimated time left.

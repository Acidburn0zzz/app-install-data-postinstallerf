libcaca is the Colour AsCii Art library. It provides high level functions
for color text drawing, simple primitives for line, polygon and ellipse
drawing, as well as powerful image to text conversion routines.

This package contains the header files and static libraries needed to
compile applications or shared objects that use libcaca.

METAR is a French acronym for Aviation Routine Weather Report. It is the
standard format for reporting meteorological conditions. As a free service,
the National Weather Service continually updates a server with METARs from all
over the world.

The MDSP Library provides a programmer with two functions, the major one
being DcdMETAR, which decodes a METAR into structures provided by the
library. Also prtDMETR, which prints out a decoded METAR structure.

This is the icculus.org Linux port of Apogees classic 3d shooter Rise of the
Triad (RotT), which has been released under the GPL by Apogee. This version is
enhanced with the "high" resolution rendering from the winrott port.

This package contains the engine for the shareware version of RotT. In order to
play the shareware version, you will need the shareware datafiles. Which can
be freely downloaded from Apogee/3DRealms, but cannot be distributed as a part
of Fedora. When you start RotT for the first time it will offer to download
the datafiles for you.

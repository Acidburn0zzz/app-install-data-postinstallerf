Comment3='
This Perl module implements Perl hashes that preserve the order in
which the hash elements were added. The order is not affected when
values corresponding to existing keys in the IxHash are changed.
The elements can also be set to any arbitrary supplied order. The
familiar perl array operations can also be performed on the IxHash.

Kiwi consists of a set of classes and wrappers for PyGTK that were
developed to provide a sort of framework for applications. Fully
object-oriented, and roughly Smalltalks MVC, Kiwi provides a simple,
practical way to build forms, windows and widgets that transparently
access and display your object data.

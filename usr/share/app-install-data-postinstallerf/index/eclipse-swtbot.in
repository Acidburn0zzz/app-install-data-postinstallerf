SWTBot is a Java based UI/functional testing tool for testing SWT and Eclipse
based applications. SWTBot provides APIs that are simple to read and write.
The APIs also hide the complexities involved with SWT and Eclipse. This makes
it suitable for UI/functional testing by everyone, not just developers.

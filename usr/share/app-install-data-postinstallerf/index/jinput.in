jinput is an implementation of an API for game controller discovery and
polled input.  It is part of a suite of open-source technologies
intention of making the development of high performance games in Java a
reality.  The API itself is pure Java and presents a platform-neutral,
completely portable model of controller discovery and polling.  It can
handle arbitrary controllers and returns both human and machine
understandable descriptions of the inputs available.

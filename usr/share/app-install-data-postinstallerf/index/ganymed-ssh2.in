Comment3='
Ganymed SSH-2 for Java is a library which implements the SSH-2 protocol in pure
Java (tested on J2SE 1.4.2 and 5.0). It allows one to connect to SSH servers
from within Java programs. It supports SSH sessions (remote command execution
and shell access), local and remote port forwarding, local stream forwarding,
X11 forwarding and SCP. There are no dependencies on any JCE provider, as all
crypto functionality is included.

This package contains the optional PARI package seadata, which provides the
modular polynomials for prime level up to 500 needed by the GP functions
ellap and ellsea.

These polynomials were extracted from the ECHIDNA databases available at
<http//echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/dbs/> and computed by David R. Kohel
at the University of Sydney.

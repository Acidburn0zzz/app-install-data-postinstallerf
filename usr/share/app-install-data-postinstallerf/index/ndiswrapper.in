Comment3='
The ndiswrapper project makes it possible to use WLAN-Hardware
with Linux by means of a loadable kernel module that "wraps
around" NDIS (Windows network driver API) drivers.  These rpms contain
just the kernel module and loader. You will also need the Windows driver
for your card.

WARNING Fedora-Kernels use 4K size stack. Many Windows drivers
will need at least 8K size stacks. For details read the wiki on

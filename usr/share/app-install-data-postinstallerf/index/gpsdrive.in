Gpsdrive is a map-based navigation system.
It displays your position on a zoomable map
provided from a NMEA-capable GPS receiver. The maps are autoselected
for the best resolution, depending of your position, and the displayed
image can be zoomed. Maps can be downloaded from the Internet with one
mouse click. The program provides information about speed, direction,
bearing, arrival time, actual position, and target position.
Speech output is also available. MySQL is supported.

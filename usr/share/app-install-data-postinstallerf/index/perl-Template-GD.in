The Template-GD distribution provides a number of Template Toolkit
plugin modules to interface with Lincoln Steins GD modules.  These in
turn provide an interface to Thomas Boutells GD graphics library.

These plugins were distributed as part of the Template Toolkit until
version 2.15 released in February 2006.  At this time they were
extracted into this separate distribution.

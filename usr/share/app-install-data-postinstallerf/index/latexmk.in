Latexmk is a perl script for running LaTeX the correct number of times to
resolve cross references, etc.; it also runs auxiliary programs (bibtex,
makeindex if necessary, and dvips and/or a previewer as requested).  It has
a number of other useful capabilities, for example to start a previewer and
then run latex whenever the source files are updated, so that the previewer
gives an up-to-date view of the document.  The script runs on both UNIX and
MS-WINDOWS (95, ME, XP, etc).  This script is a corrected and improved
version of the original version of latexmk.

Before using a previewer, read the file README.fedora.

A perl 5 module for sorting of revision-like numbers

SortVersions allows easy sorting of mixed non-numeric and numeric strings,
like the version numbers that many shared library systems and revision
control packages use. This is quite useful if you are trying to deal with
shared libraries. It can also be applied to applications that intersperse
variable-width numeric fields within text. Other applications can
undoubtedly be found.

MetaKit is an embeddable database which runs on Unix, Windows,
Macintosh, and other platforms. It lets you build applications which
store their data efficiently, in a portable way, and which will not
need a complex runtime installation. In terms of the data model,
MetaKit takes the middle ground between RDBMS, OODBMS, and flat-file
databases - yet it is quite different from each of them.

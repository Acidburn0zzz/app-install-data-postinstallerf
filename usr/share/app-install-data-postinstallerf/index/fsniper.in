fsniper is a tool that monitors a given set of directories for new
files. Then, based on the new files type or name, it invokes a script to
be run (any executable via the shell) on that file.  Common uses include
making a single drop directory for all things from a webbrowser etc, and
having semi-intelligent scripts figure out what to do with those files. You
write the scripts yourself.

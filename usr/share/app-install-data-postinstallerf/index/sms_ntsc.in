Comment3='
Sega Master System NTSC video filter library. Reproduces the significant
artifacts on the vertical edges of some colors that occur when colours, and
the general color mixing that occur when graphics are rendered via an NTSC
video connection to a television. Accepts pixels in 16-bit RGB or 12-bit BGR
(native Game Gear palette format). It can also output an RGB palette for use
in a regular blitter.

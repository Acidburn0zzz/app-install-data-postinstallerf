SinatraRabbit is a Sinatra extensions that makes designing a REST API much
easier and more fun.
Rabbit maps REST resources to collections. Every collection then could define
CRUD and other operations to manipulate with resource. Rabbit will handle
parameter validation and capability checks for you, so you can focus on the
structure and design of your REST API.

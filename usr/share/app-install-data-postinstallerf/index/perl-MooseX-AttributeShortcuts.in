Ever find yourself repeatedly specifying writers and builders, because theres
no good shortcut to specify them? Sometimes you want an attribute to have
a read-only public interface, but a private writer. And wouldnt it be easier
to just say "builder => 1" and have the attribute construct the canonical
"_build_$name" builder name for you?

This package causes an attribute trait to be applied to all attributes defined
to the using class. This trait extends the attribute option processing to
handle the above variations.

dsi is a simple game of invading aliens. You must stop those aliens from
landing on you. It features smooth scrolling, high scores, 5 levels, simple
controls, sound effects, strategic game play, and a tiny footprint. The
graphics can be customized out of the box, without requiring any recompiling.
A simple definition file can be customized for coders.

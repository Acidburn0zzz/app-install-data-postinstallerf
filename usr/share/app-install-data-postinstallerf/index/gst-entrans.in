GEntrans is a software package providing a collection of plug-ins and tools
for the GStreamer multimedia framework specifically geared towards transcoding
and recording purposes.

GStreamer allows for easy multimedia processing and creation of multimedia
applications, as e.g. demonstrated by a number of players and some other
applications already built on it. The purpose here is to concentrate on using
the framework for transcoding purposes.

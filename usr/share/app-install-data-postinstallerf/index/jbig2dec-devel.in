jbig2dec is a decoder implementation of the JBIG2 image compression format.
JBIG2 is designed for lossy or lossless encoding of bilevel (1-bit
monochrome) images at moderately high resolution, and in particular scanned
paper documents. In this domain it is very efficient, offering compression
ratios on the order of 1001.

This package is only needed if you plan to develop or compile applications
which requires the jbig2dec library.

Comment3='
collectd is a small daemon written in C for performance.  It reads various
system  statistics  and updates  RRD files,  creating  them if necessary.
Since the daemon doesnt need to startup every time it wants to update the
files its very fast and easy on the system. Also, the statistics are very
fine grained since the files are updated every 10 seconds.

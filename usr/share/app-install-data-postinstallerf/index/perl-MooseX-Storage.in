Comment3='
MooseXStorage is a serialization framework for Moose, it provides a
very flexible and highly pluggable way to serialize Moose classes to a
number of different formats and styles. This is still an early release
of this module, so use with caution. Its outward facing serialization
API should be considered stable, but I still reserve the right to make
tweaks if I need too. Anything beyond the basic pack/unpack, freeze/thaw
and load/store should not be relied on. There are 3 levels to the
serialization, each of which builds upon the other and each of which
can be customized to the specific needs of your class.

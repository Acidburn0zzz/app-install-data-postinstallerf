EekBoek is a bookkeeping package for small and medium-size businesses.
Unlike other accounting software, EekBoek has both a command-line
interface (CLI) and a graphical user-interface (GUI, currently under
development and not included in this package). Furthermore, it has a
complete Perl API to create your own custom applications. EekBoek is
designed for the Dutch/European market and currently available in
Dutch only. An English translation is in the works (help appreciated).

EekBoek can make use of several database systems for its storage.
Support for the SQLite database is included.

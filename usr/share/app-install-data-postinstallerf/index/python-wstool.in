Comment3='
wstool provides commands to manage several local SCM repositories (supports
git, mercurial, subversion, bazaar) based on a single workspace definition file
(.rosinstall).

wstool replaces the rosws tool for catkin workspaces. As catkin workspaces
create their own setup file and environment, wstool is reduced to version
control functions only. So wstool does not have a "regenerate" command, and
does not allow adding non-version controlled elements to workspaces. In all
other respects, it behaves the same as rosws.

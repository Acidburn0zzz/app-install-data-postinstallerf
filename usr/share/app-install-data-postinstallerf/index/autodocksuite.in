AutoDock is a suite of automated docking tools. It is designed to predict \
how small molecules, such as substrates or drug candidates, bind to a \
receptor of known 3D structure. AutoDock 4 actually consists of two main \
programs autodock performs the docking of the ligand to a set of grids \
describing the target protein; autogrid pre-calculates these grids. In \
addition to using them for docking, the atomic affinity grids can be \
visualized. This can help, for example, to guide organic synthetic chemists \
design better binders.

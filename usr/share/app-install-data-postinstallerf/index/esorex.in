EsoRex is the ESO Recipe Execution Tool. It can list, configure and
execute CPL-based recipes from the command line.
One of the features provided by the CPL is the ability to create
data-reduction algorithms that run as plugins (dynamic libraries). These
are called recipes and are one of the main aspects of the
CPL data-reduction development environment.

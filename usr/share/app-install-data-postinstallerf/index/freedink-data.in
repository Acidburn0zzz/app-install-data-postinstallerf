Dink Smallwood is an adventure/role-playing game, similar to Zelda,
made by RTsoft. Besides twisted humour, it includes the actual game
editor, allowing players to create hundreds of new adventures called
Dink Modules or D-Mods for short.

This package contains architecture-independent data for the original
game, along with free sound and music replacements.

Comment3='
rb_libtorrent is a C++ library that aims to be a good alternative to all
the other BitTorrent implementations around. It is a library and not a full
featured client, although it comes with a few working example clients.

Its main goals are to be very efficient (in terms of CPU and memory usage) as
well as being very easy to use both as a user and developer.

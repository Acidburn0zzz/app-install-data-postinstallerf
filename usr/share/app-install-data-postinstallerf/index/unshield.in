Comment3='
To install a Pocket PC application remotely, an installable
Microsoft Cabinet File is copied to the /Windows/AppMgr/Install
directory on the PDA and then the wceload.exe is executed to
perform the actual install. That is a very simple procedure.

Unfortunately, many applications for Pocket PC are distributed as
InstallShield installers for Microsoft Windows, and not as
individual Microsoft Cabinet Files. That is very impractical for
users of other operating systems, such as Linux or FreeBSD.

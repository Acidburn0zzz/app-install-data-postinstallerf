The ddpt utility is a variant of the standard Unix command dd which copies
files. The ddpt utility specializes in files that are block devices. For block
devices that understand the SCSI command set, finer grain control over the
copy may be available via a SCSI pass-through interface. Note that recent
(S)ATA disks can often be driven by SCSI commands due to SCSI to ATA
translation (SAT) implemented in the kernel.

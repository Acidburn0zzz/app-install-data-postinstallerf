GlueMiniSat is a boolean, propositional satisfiability (SAT) problem
solver. It is a derivative work of the open source MiniSat 2.2 solver,
and implements a form of the literal blocks distance (LBD) evaluation
criteria to predict the quality of clauses learned when conflicts are
encountered in the search process.

The underlying concepts of literal blocks distance were first introduced
in the paper "Predicting learnt clauses quality in modern SAT solvers"
by Gilles Audemard and Laurent Simon, Proceedings of IJCAI-2009, pages
399-404, 2009. The authors implementation of LBD, the Glucose 1.0 SAT

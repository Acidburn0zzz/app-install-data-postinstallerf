The packages offers two styles philosophy-classic and
philosophy-modern, that facilitate the production of produce
two different kinds of bibliography, based on the authoryear
style, with options and features to manage the information
about the translation of foreign texts or their reprints.
Though the packages default settings are based on the
conventions used in Italian publications, these styles can be
used with every language recognized by babel, possibly with
some simple redefinitions.

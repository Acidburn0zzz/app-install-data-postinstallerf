CVSps is a program for generating patchset information from a CVS
repository.  A patchset in this case is defined as a set of changes
made to a collection of files, and all committed at the same time
(using a single cvs commit command).  This information is valuable
to seeing the big picture of the evolution of a cvs project.  While
cvs tracks revision information, it is often difficult to see what
changes were committed atomically to the repository.

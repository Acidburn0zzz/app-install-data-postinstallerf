HMAC is used for message integrity checks between two parties that
share a secret key, and works in combination with some other Digest
algorithm, usually MD5 or SHA-1. The HMAC mechanism is described in
RFC 2104.

HMAC follow the common Digest interface, but the constructor takes
the secret key and the name of some other simple Digest as argument.

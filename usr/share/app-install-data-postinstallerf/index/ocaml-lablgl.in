Comment3='
LablGL is is an Objective Caml interface to OpenGL. Support is
included for use inside LablTk, and LablGTK also includes specific
support for LablGL.  It can be used either with proprietary OpenGL
implementations (SGI, Digital Unix, Solaris...), with XFree86 GLX
extension, or with open-source Mesa.

Comment3='
TagSoup is a SAX-compliant parser written in Java that, instead of
parsing well-formed or valid XML, parses HTML as it is found in the wild nasty
and brutish, though quite often far from short. TagSoup is designed for people
who have to process this stuff using some semblance of a rational application
design. By providing a SAX interface, it allows standard XML tools to be
applied to even the worst HTML.

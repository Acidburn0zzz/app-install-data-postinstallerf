Comment3='
fio is an I/O tool that will spawn a number of threads or processes doing
a particular type of io action as specified by the user.  fio takes a
number of global parameters, each inherited by the thread unless
otherwise parameters given to them overriding that setting is given.
The typical use of fio is to write a job file matching the io load
one wants to simulate.

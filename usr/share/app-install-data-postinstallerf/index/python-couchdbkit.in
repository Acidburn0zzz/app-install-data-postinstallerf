Couchdbkit provides you a full featured and easy client to access and manage
CouchDB. It allows you to manage a CouchDBserver, databases, doc managements
and view access. All objects mostly reflect python objects for convenience.
Server and Databases objects could be used for example as easy as using dicts.

This is an SQL to OO mapper with an object API inspired by ClassDBI
(and a compatibility layer as a springboard for porting) and a
resultset API that allows abstract encapsulation of database
operations. It aims to make representing queries in your code as perl-
ish as possible while still providing access to as many of the
capabilities of the database as possible, including retrieving related
records from multiple tables in a single query, JOIN, LEFT JOIN, COUNT,
DISTINCT, GROUP BY and HAVING support.

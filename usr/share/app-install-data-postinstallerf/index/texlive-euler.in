Comment='<span size="xx-large">Use AMS Euler fonts for math</span>'
Comment3='
Provides a setup for using the AMS Euler family of fonts for
mathematics in LaTeX documents. "The underlying philosophy of
Zapfs Euler design was to capture the flavour of mathematics
as it might be written by a mathematician with excellent
handwriting." [concrete-tug] The euler package is based on
Knuths macros for the book Concrete Mathematics. The text
fonts for the Concrete book are supported by the beton package.

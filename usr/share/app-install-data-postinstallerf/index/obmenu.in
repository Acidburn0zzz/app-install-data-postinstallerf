obmenu is a graphical menu editor for the Openbox window manager. Openbox uses
XML to store its menu preferences, and editing these by hand can quickly become
tedious; and even moreso when generating an entire menu for oneself! However,
this utility provides a convenient method of editing the menu in a graphical
interface, while not losing the powerful features of Openbox such as its
pipe menus.

This also provides a Python module named obxml that can be used to further
script Openboxs menu system.

GLUI is a GLUT-based C++ user interface library which provides controls
such as buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, and spinners to OpenGL applications.
It is window-system independent, relying on GLUT to handle all system-dependent
issues, such as window and mouse management.

These are the development files.

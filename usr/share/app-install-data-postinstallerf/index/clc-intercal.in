Comment3='
This package provides a Perl-based compiler for the INTERCAL programming
language, usable either from the command line or as a Perl module.

CLC-INTERCAL is designed to be almost compatible with the original (Princeton
1972) compiler. It also implements several extensions to the original language,
including support for object orientation, operator overloading and quantum
computing.

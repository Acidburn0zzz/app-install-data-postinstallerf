Wolfenstein 3D.

Maybe it was the fact that people got to blow away Nazis. Maybe it was the
sheer challenge of it all. For whatever reason, Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of
Destiny, pioneered the first-person shooter genre and brought its legendary
creators, id Software, worldwide notoriety and numerous awards. In fact, The
Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame recognized Wolfenstein 3D as helping to

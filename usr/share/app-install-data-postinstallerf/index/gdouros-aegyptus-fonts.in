Comment3='
Aegyptus encodes over 7000 hieroglyphs.

There is no standard for Egyptian Hieroglyphs or Meroitic, so they are
allocated in the Supplementary Private Use Plane 15. The font also covers Basic
Latin, Egyptian Transliteration characters, some Punctuation and other Symbols,
and the Gardiner set of 1071 Egyptian Hieroglyphs, now suppored by The Unicode
Standard 5.2 in the new SMP block 13000 - 1342F.
It was created by George Douros, mainly based on the book Hieroglyphica,
PIREI I?, 2000 and the work of Alan Gardiner.

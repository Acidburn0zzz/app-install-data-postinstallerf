A family of sans serif fonts for TeX and LaTeX, based on Donald
Knuths CM fonts. It comprises OT1, T1 and TS1 encoded text
fonts of various shapes as well as all the fonts necessary for
mathematical typesetting, including AMS symbols. This
collection provides all the necessary files for using the fonts
with LaTeX. A commercial-quality Adobe Type 1 version of these
fonts is available from Micropress. Free versions are
available, in the cm-super font bundle (the T1 and TS1 encoded
part of the set), and in the hfbright (the OT1 encoded part,
and the maths fonts).

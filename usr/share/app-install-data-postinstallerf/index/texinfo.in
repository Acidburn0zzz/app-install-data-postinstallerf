Texinfo is a documentation system that can produce both online
information and printed output from a single source file. The GNU
Project uses the Texinfo file format for most of its documentation.

Install texinfo if you want a documentation system for producing both
online and print documentation from the same source file and/or if you
are going to write documentation for the GNU Project.

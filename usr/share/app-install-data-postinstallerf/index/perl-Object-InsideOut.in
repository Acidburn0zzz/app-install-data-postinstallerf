Comment3='
This module provides comprehensive support for implementing classes using the
inside-out object model.

This module implements inside-out objects as anonymous scalar references that
are blessed into a class with the scalar containing the ID for the object
(usually a sequence number). Object data (i.e., fields) are stored within the
classs package in either arrays indexed by the objects ID, or hashes keyed
to the objects ID.

The package helps to keep track of formal concepts for a
specific field or document. This is particularly useful for
scientific papers (for example, in physics, mathematics or
computer science), which may introduce several concepts (with
their own symbols). The packages commands allow the user to
define a concept (typically, near its first use), and will
ensure consistent use throughout the document. The package
depends on several other packages; while these are fairly
common packages, the user should check the packages README
file for the complete list.

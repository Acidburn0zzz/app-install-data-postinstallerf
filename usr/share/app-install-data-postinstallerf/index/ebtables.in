Ethernet bridge tables is a firewalling tool to transparently filter network
traffic passing a bridge. The filtering possibilities are limited to link
layer filtering and some basic filtering on higher network layers.

This tool is the userspace control for the bridge and ebtables kernel
components (built by default in Fedora kernels).
The ebtables tool can be used together with the other Linux filtering tools,
like iptables. There are no known incompatibility issues.

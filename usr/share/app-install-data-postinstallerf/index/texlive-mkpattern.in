Mkpattern is a general purpose program for the generation of
hyphenation patterns, with definition of letter sets and
template-like constructions. It also provides an easy way to
handle different input and output encodings, and featgures
generation of clean UTF-8 patterns. The package was used for
the creation of the Galician patterns.

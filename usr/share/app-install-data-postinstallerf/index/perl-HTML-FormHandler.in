HTMLFormHandler is a form handling class that validates HTML form data and,
for database forms, saves it to the database on validation. It has field
classes that can be used for creating a set of widgets and highly automatic
templates. There are two simple rendering roles plus a set of widget roles for
individual form and field classes. FormHandler is designed to make it easy to
produce alternative rendering modules.

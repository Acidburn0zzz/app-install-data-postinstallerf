CPM is a ncurses based console tool to manage passwords
and store them public key encrypted in a file - even for
more than one person. The encryption is handled via GnuPG
so the programs data can be accessed via gpg as well,
in case you want to have a look inside. The data is stored
as as zlib compressed XML so it?s even possible to reuse
the data for some other purpose.

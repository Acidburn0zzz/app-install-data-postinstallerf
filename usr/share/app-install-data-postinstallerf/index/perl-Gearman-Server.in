Comment3='
You run a Gearman server (or more likely, many of them for both high-
availability and load balancing), then have workers (using GearmanWorker
from the Gearman module, or libraries for other languages) register their
ability to do certain functions to all of them, and then clients (using
GearmanClient, GearmanClientAsync, etc) request work to be done from
one of the Gearman servers.

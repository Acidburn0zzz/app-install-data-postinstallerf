Anacron is part of cronie that is used for running jobs with regular
periodicity which do not have exact time of day of execution.

The default settings of anacron execute the daily, weekly, and monthly
jobs, but anacron allows setting arbitrary periodicity of jobs.
Using anacron allows running the periodic jobs even if the system is often
powered off and it also allows randomizing the time of the job execution
for better utilization of resources shared among multiple systems.

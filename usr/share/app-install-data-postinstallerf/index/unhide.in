Unhide is a forensic tool to find processes and TCP/UDP ports hidden by
rootkits, Linux kernel modules or by other techniques. It includes two
utilities unhide and unhide-tcp.

Unhide detects hidden processes using three techniques
 - comparing the output of /proc and /bin/ps
 - comparing the information gathered from /bin/ps with the one gathered
   from system calls (syscall scanning)
 - full scan of the process ID space (PIDs bruteforcing)

Mpmath is a pure-Python library for multiprecision floating-point arithmetic.
It provides an extensive set of transcendental functions, unlimited exponent
sizes, complex numbers, interval arithmetic, numerical integration and
differentiation, root-finding, linear algebra, and much more. Almost any
calculation can be performed just as well at 10-digit or 1000-digit precision,
and in many cases mpmath implements asymptotically fast algorithms that scale
well for extremely high precision work. If available, mpmath will (optionally)
use gmpy to speed up high precision operations.

If you require plotting capabilities in mpmath, install python3-matplotlib.

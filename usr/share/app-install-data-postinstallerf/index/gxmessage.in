Comment3='
Gxmassage is a GTK2 based xmessage clone. It pops up a dialog window, displays
a given message or question, then waits for the users response. That response
is returned as the programs exit code. Because gxmessage is a drop-in
alternative to xmessage, gxmessage accepts any option xmessage would, and
returns the same exit codes.

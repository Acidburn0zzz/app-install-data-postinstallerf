ElectricFence is a utility for C programming and
debugging. ElectricFence uses the virtual memory hardware of your
system to detect when software overruns malloc() buffer boundaries,
and/or to detect any accesses of memory released by
free(). ElectricFence will then stop the program on the first
instruction that caused a bounds violation and you can use your
favorite debugger to display the offending statement.

Install ElectricFence if you need a debugger to find malloc()
violations.

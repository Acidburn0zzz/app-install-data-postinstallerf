Nemiver is an ongoing effort to write a standalone graphical debugger that
integrates well in the GNOME desktop environment. It currently features a
backend which uses the well known GNU Debugger (gdb) to debug C/C++ programs.

The yelp package must be installed to make use of Nemivers documentation.

tnftp is the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client from NetBSD.  FTP is a widely
used protocol for transferring files over the Internet and for archiving files.
tnftp provides some advanced features beyond the Linux netkit ftp client, but
maintains a similar user interface to the traditional ftp client.  It was
formerly called lukemftp.

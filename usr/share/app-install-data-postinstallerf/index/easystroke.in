Easystroke is a gesture-recognition application for X11. Gestures or strokes
are movements that you make with you mouse (or your pen, finger etc.) while
holding down a specific mouse button. Easystroke will execute certain actions
if it recognizes the stroke; currently easystroke can emulate key presses,
execute shell commands, hold down modifiers and emulate a scroll wheel.

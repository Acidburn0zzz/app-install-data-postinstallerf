Comment3='
This package contains BFD and opcodes static and dynamic libraries.

The dynamic libraries are in this package, rather than a seperate
base package because they are actually linker scripts that force
the use of the static libraries.  This is because the API of the
BFD library is too unstable to be used dynamically.
The static libraries are here because they are now needed by the
dynamic libraries.

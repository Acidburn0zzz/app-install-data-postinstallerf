Comment3='
NArray is a Numerical N-dimensional Array class.  Supported element
types are 1/2/4-byte Integer, single/double-precision, Real/Complex and
Ruby Object.  This extension library incorporates fast calculation and
easy manipulation of large numerical arrays into the Ruby language.
NArray has features similar to NumPy, but NArray has vector and matrix
sub-classes.

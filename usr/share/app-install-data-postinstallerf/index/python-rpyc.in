RPyC, or Remote Python Call, is a transparent and symmetrical python library
for remote procedure calls, clustering and distributed-computing.
RPyC makes use of object-proxies, a technique that employs pythons dynamic
nature, to overcome the physical boundaries between processes and computers,
so that remote objects can be manipulated as if they were local.

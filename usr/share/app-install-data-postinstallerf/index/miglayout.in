MiGLayout is a versatile SWT/Swing layout manager.  It uses String or
API type-checked constraints to format the layout. MiGLayout can
produce flowing, grid based, absolute (with links), grouped and
docking layouts. MiGLayout is created to be to manually coded layouts
what Matisse/GroupLayout is to IDE supported visual layouts.

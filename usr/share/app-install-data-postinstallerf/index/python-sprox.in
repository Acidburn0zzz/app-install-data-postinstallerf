Sprox is a widget generation library that has a slightly different take on the
problem of creating custom web content directly from database schemas. Sprox
provides an easy way to create forms for web content which are automatically
generated, easy to customize, and validated. Sprox also has powerful tools to
help you display your content the way you want to with table and record
viewers. Sprox provides a way to fill your widgets, whether they are forms or
other content with customizable data.

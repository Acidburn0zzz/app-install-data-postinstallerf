Httperf is a tool for measuring web server performance. It provides a
flexible facility for generating various HTTP workloads and for
measuring server performance. The focus of httperf is not on
implementing one particular benchmark but on providing a robust,
high-performance tool that facilitates the construction of both micro-
and macro-level benchmarks. The three distinguishing characteristics
of httperf are its robustness, which includes the ability to generate
and sustain server overload, support for the HTTP/1.1 and SSL
protocols, and its extensibility to new workload generators and
performance measurements.

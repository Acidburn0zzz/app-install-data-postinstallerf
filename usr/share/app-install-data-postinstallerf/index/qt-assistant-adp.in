Comment3='
The old version of Qt Assistant, based on Assistant Document Profile (.adp)
files, and the associated QtAssistantClient library, for compatibility with
applications providing help in that format.

New applications should use the new version of Qt Assistant introduced in Qt
4.4, based on the Qt Help Framework also introduced in Qt 4.4, instead.

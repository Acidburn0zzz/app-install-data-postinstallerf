TGCaptcha2 is a TurboGears widget that provides an easy way to
incorporate a captcha as part a form in an attempt to reduce spam or
malicious activity.

Features include
  * (Relatively) pain-free usage and validation inside of a regular
      widget-based form
  * Flexibility to add or extend image generation algorithms and the
      text displayed in the image

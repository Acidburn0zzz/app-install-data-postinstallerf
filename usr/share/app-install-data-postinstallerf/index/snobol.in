SNOBOL4, while known primarily as a string language excels at any task
involving symbolic manipulations.  It provides run time typing,
garbage collection, user data types, on the fly compilation.  Its
primary weakness is its simple syntax, and lack of "structured
programming" and "object oriented" constructs.

Torsmo (TyopoytaORvelo System MOnitor) is a system monitor that sits in the
corner of your desktop. Torsmo can show various information about your system
and its peripherals. Torsmo is very light and customizable, and it renders
text on the root window.

For a sample configuration take a look torsmorc.sample.

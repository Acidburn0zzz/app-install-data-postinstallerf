Libglade is a small library that allows a program to load its user interface
from am XML description at runtime. Libglade uses the XML file format used by
the GLADE user interface builder GLADE, so libglade acts as an alternative to
GLADEs code generation approach. Libglade also provides a simple interface
for connecting handlers to the various signals in the interface (on platforms
where the gmodule library works correctly, it is possible to connect all the
handlers with a single function call). Once the interface has been
instantiated, libglade gives no overhead, so other than the short initial
interface loading time, there is no performance tradeoff.

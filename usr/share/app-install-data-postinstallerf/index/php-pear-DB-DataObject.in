DataObject performs 2 tasks
1. Builds SQL statements based on the objects vars and the builder methods.
2. acts as a datastore for a table row.

The core class is designed to be extended for each of your tables so that you
put the data logic inside the data classes. Included is a Generator to make
your configuration files and your base classes.

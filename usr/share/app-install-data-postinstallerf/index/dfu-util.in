USB Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) is an official USB device class specification
of the USB Implementers Forum. It specifies a vendor and device independent way
of updating the firmware of a USB device. The idea is to have only one
vendor-independent firmware update tool as part of the operating system, which
can then (given a particular firmware image) be downloaded into the device.

In addition to firmware download, it also specifies firmware upload, i.e.
loading the currently installed device firmware to the USB Host.

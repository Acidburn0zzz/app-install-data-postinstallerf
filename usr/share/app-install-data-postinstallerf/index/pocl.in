Pocls goal is to become an efficient open source (MIT-licensed) implementation
of the OpenCL 1.2 (and soon OpenCL 2.0) standard.

In addition to producing an easily portable open-source OpenCL implementation,
another major goal of this project is improving performance portability of
OpenCL programs with compiler optimizations, reducing the need for
target-dependent manual optimizations.
At the core of pocl is the kernel compiler that consists of a set of LLVM
passes used to statically transform kernels into work-group functions with

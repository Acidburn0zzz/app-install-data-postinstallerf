HTCondor is a workload management system for high-throughput and
high-performance jobs. Like other full-featured batch systems, HTCondor
provides a job queueing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme,
resource monitoring, and resource management. Users submit their
serial or parallel jobs to HTCondor, HTCondor places them into a queue,
chooses when and where to run the jobs based upon a policy, carefully
monitors their progress, and ultimately informs the user upon
completion.

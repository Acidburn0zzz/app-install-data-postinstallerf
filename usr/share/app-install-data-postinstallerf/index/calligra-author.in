Calligra Author is a specialized tool for serious writers aiming to become
what Krita is for painters. The application will support a writer in the
process of creating an eBook from concept to publication. We have two user
categories in particular in mind
* Novelists who produce long texts with complicated plots involving many
  characters and scenes but with limited formatting.
* Textbook authors who want to take advantage of the added possibilities
  in eBooks compared to paper-based textbooks.

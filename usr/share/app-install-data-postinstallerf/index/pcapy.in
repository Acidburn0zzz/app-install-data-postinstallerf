Pcapy is a Python extension module that interfaces with the libpcap
packet capture library. Pcapy enables python scripts to capture packets
on the network. Pcapy is highly effective when used in conjunction with
a packet-handling package such as Impacket, which is a collection of
Python classes for constructing and dissecting network packets.

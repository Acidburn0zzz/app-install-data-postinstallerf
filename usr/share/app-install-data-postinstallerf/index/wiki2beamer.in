Wiki2beamer converts a simple wiki-like syntax to complex LaTeX beamer code.
Its written in python and should run on windows and all *nix platforms. Why
collaborative? Because you can use it with version control systems. Afraid
to loose some LaTeX powers? Dont worry you can always fall back to plain
LaTeX as wiki2beamer is just a preprocessor.

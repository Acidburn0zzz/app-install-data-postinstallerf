Comment3='
This Node.js module is a fast, minimalist web development framework inspired
by Sinatra.

The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers.
Making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids,
or public HTTP APIs.
Built on Connect you can use only what you need, and nothing more,
applications can be as big or as small as you like, even a single file.
Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With

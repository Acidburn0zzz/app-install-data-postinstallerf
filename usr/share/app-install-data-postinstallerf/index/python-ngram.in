Comment3='

The NGram class extends the Python set class with efficient fuzzy
search for members by means of an N-gram similarity measure.  It
also has static methods to compare a pair of strings.
The N-grams are character based not word-based, and the class does
not implement a language model, merely searching for members by
string similarity.

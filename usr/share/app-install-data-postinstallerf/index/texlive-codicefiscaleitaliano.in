The alphanumeric string that forms the Italian personal Fiscal
Code is prone to be misspelled thus rendering a legal document
invalid. The package quickly verifies the consistency of the
fiscal code string, and can therefore be useful for lawyers and
accountants that use fiscal codes very frequently.

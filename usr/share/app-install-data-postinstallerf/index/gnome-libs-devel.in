GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment) is a user-friendly set of GUI
applications and desktop tools to be used in conjunction with a window manager
for the X Window System. The gnome-libs-devel package includes the libraries
and include files that you will need to develop GNOME 1.x applications.

You should install the gnome-libs-devel package if you would like to develop
GNOME 1.x applications. You do not need to install gnome-libs-devel if you just
want to use the GNOME desktop environment.

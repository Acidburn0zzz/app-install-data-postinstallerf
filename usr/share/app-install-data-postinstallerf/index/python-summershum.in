A fedmsg consumer that extracts and stores hashes of source files.

summershum is composed of two components
- A fedmsg consumer plugin that listens for
  ``org.fedoraproject.prod.git.lookaside.new`` messages.  Whenever a
  contributor uploads a new source tarball to the lookaside cache,
  summershum will download that tarball, unpack it, and calculate the
  sha1 sum of every file in the tarball.  Those hashes are then stored in
  a database to be queried later.

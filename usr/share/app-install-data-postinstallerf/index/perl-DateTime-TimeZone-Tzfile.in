An instance of this class represents a timezone that was encoded in a file
in the tzfile(5) format. These can express arbitrary patterns of offsets
from Universal Time, changing over time. Offsets and change times are
limited to a resolution of one second.

This class implements the DateTimeTimeZone interface, so that its instances
can be used with DateTime objects.

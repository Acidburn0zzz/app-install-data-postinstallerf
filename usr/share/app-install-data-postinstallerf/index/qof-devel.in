QOF - The Query Object Framework is a C library that provides a query engine
to C applications.  This allows SQL-like queries to be performes on a
collection of C/C++ objects (which act like SQL tables).

This package contains the header files and  static libraries to develop
programs that will use the qof library.  You should
install this package if you need to develop programs which will use the qof
library functions.  Youll also need to install the qof package.

freeglut is a completely open source alternative to the OpenGL Utility Toolkit
(GLUT) library with an OSI approved free software license. GLUT was originally
written by Mark Kilgard to support the sample programs in the second edition
OpenGL RedBook. Since then, GLUT has been used in a wide variety of practical
applications because it is simple, universally available and highly portable.

freeglut allows the user to create and manage windows containing OpenGL
contexts on a wide range of platforms and also read the mouse, keyboard and
joystick functions.

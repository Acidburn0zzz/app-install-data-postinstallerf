Comment3='
PP3 creates celestial charts.  It generates resolution independent
maps of very high graphical quality in Postscript or PDF format.
They can be used for example as illustrations in books or on web
pages.  You may use the databases of the distribution or your own
databases converted to PP3s simple text format.

PP3 uses LaTeX+pstricks as the backend for generating the vector
graphics.  You can add arbitrary labels to the map.  The output is
configurable in many ways.

ModuleBuild is a system for building, testing, and installing Perl
modules. It is meant to be an alternative to ExtUtilsMakeMaker.
Developers may alter the behavior of the module through sub-classing in a
much more straightforward way than with MakeMaker. It also does not require
a make on your system - most of the ModuleBuild code is pure-perl and
written in a very cross-platform way. In fact, you dont even need a shell,
so even platforms like MacOS (traditional) can use it fairly easily. Its
only prerequisites are modules that are included with perl 5.6.0, and it
works fine on perl 5.005 if you can install a few additional modules.

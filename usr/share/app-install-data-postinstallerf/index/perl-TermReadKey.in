Comment3='
TermReadKey is a compiled perl module dedicated to providing simple
control over terminal driver modes (cbreak, raw, cooked, etc.)
support for non-blocking reads, if the architecture allows, and some
generalized handy functions for working with terminals.  One of the
main goals is to have the functions as portable as possible, so you
can just plug in "use TermReadKey" on any architecture and have a
good likelyhood of it working.

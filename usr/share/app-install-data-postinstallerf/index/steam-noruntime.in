Comment3='
The Steam client normally uses a set of libraries derived from Ubuntu (the Steam
Runtime); and all titles on Steam are compiled against those libraries.

This package takes care of installing all the requirements to use system
libraries in place of the Steam Runtime and a profile environment file to enable
it. Please note that this is not a supported Valve configuration and it may lead
to unexpected results.

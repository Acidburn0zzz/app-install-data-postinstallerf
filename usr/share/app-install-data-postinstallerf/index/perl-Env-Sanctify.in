EnvSanctify is a module that provides lexically-scoped manipulation and
sanctification of %ENV. You can specify that it alter or add additional
environment variables or remove existing ones according to a list of matching
regexen. You can then either restore the environment back manually or let the
object fall out of scope, which automagically restores. Its useful for
manipulating the environment that forked processes and sub-processes will
inherit.

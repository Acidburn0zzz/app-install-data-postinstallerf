Ibycus is a Greek typeface, based on Silvio Levys realisation
of a classic Didot cut of Greek type from around 1800. The
fonts are available both as MetaFont source and in Adobe Type 1
format. This distribution of ibycus is accompanied by a set of
macro packages to use it with Plain TeX or LaTeX, but for use
with Babel, see the ibycus-babel package.

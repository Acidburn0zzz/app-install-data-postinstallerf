Comment3='
This module will allow Drupal to replace textarea fields with the CKEditor -
a visual HTML editor, sometimes called WYSIWYG editor. This HTML text editor
brings many of the powerful WYSIWYG editing functions of known desktop
editors like Word to the web. Its very fast and doesnt require any kind of
installation on the client computer.

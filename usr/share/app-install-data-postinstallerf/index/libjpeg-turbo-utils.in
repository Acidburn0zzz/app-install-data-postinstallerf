The libjpeg-turbo-utils package contains simple client programs for accessing
the libjpeg functions. It contains cjpeg, djpeg, jpegtran, rdjpgcom and
wrjpgcom. Cjpeg compresses an image file into JPEG format. Djpeg decompresses a
JPEG file into a regular image file. Jpegtran can perform various useful
transformations on JPEG files. Rdjpgcom displays any text comments included in a
JPEG file. Wrjpgcom inserts text comments into a JPEG file.

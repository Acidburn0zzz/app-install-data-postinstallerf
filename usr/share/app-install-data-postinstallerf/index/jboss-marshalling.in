JBoss Marshalling is an alternative serialization API that fixes many
of the problems found in the JDK serialization API while remaining
fully compatible with java.io.Serializable and its relatives, and adds
several new tunable parameters and additional features, all of which
are pluggable via factory configuration (externalizers, class/instance
lookup tables, class resolution, and object replacement, to name a
few).

This module provides the user with methods to connect to a remote server,
send a stream of XML to the server, and receive/parse an XML stream from
the server.  It is primarily based work for the Etherx XML router
developed by the Jabber Development Team.  For more information about this
project visit http//etherx.jabber.org/stream/.

XMLStream gives the user the ability to define a central callback that
will be used to handle the tags received from the server.  These tags are
passed in the format defined at instantiation time.  the closing tag of an
object is seen, the tree is finished and passed to the call back function.

Comment3='
Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications.

Twisted News provides a very basic NNTP server, as well as an NNTP client
protocol implementation. Two messages storage systems are supported the DB-API
2.0 backend stores and indexes messages in any compatible SQL database; the
Twisted dirdbm backend uses serialized Python objects stored directly on the
filesystem for message storage. Twisted News also has very rudimentary support
for moderated groups.

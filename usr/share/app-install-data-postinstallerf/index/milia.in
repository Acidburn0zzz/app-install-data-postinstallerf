Milia is a C++ library created to compute cosmological distances and
ages in the Friedmann-Lema?tre-Robertson-Walker metric.
The luminosity distance is
computed using elliptical functions (Kantowski, Kao, Thomas 2000).
The remaining distances are computed from the luminosity distance using
Hogg 1999. The age is computed following Thomas & Kantowski 2000, using also
elliptical functions.

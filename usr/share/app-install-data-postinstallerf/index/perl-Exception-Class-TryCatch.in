Comment3='
ExceptionClassTryCatch provides syntactic sugar for use with
ExceptionClass using the familiar keywords try and catch. Its primary
objective is to allow users to avoid dealing directly with $@ by ensuring
that any exceptions caught in an eval are captured as ExceptionClass
objects, whether they were thrown objects to begin with or whether the
error resulted from die. This means that users may immediately use isa and
various ExceptionClass methods to process the exception.

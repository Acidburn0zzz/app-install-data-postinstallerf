Faker is a PHP library that generates fake data for you. Whether you need
to bootstrap your database, create good-looking XML documents, fill-in your
persistence to stress test it, or anonymize data taken from a production
service, Faker is for you.

Faker is heavily inspired by Perls DataFaker
(http//search.cpan.org/~jasonk/Data-Faker/), and by Rubys Faker
(http//faker.rubyforge.org/).

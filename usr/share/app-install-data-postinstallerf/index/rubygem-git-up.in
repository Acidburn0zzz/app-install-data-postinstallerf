Regular git pull has two problems
* It merges upstream changes by default, when its really more polite to
  rebase over them, unless your collaborators enjoy a commit graph that looks
  like bedhead.
* It only updates the branch youre currently on, which means git push will
  shout at you for being behind on branches you dont particularly care about
  right now.

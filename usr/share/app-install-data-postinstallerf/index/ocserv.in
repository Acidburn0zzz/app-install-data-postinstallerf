OpenConnect server (ocserv) is an SSL VPN server. Its purpose is to be a
secure, small, fast and configurable VPN server. It implements the OpenConnect
SSL VPN protocol, and has also (currently experimental) compatibility with
clients using the AnyConnect SSL VPN protocol. The OpenConnect VPN protocol
uses the standard IETF security protocols such as TLS 1.2, and Datagram TLS
to provide the secure VPN service.

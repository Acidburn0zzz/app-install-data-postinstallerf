Crumbs is a powerful breadcrumb-building machine, generating high-quality
breadcrumbs for most every page on your site, with minimal configuration.

The Crumbs engine takes advantage of the hierarchical nature inherent to
breadcrumbs It calculates the parent of the current page, the parent of
the parent, etc, until it has the complete breadcrumb trail.
Crumbs uses plugins with fine-grained user-defined priorities, for each
step in this process. Plugins for most of your favorite modules are already
built-in, and you can add more.

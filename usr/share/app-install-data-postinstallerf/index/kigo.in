Go is a strategic board game for two players. It is also known as
igo (Japanese), weiqi or wei chi (Chinese) or baduk (Korean).
Go is noted for being rich in strategic complexity despite its
simple rules.
The game is played by two players who alternately place black and
white stones (playing pieces, now usually made of glass or plastic)
on the vacant intersections of a grid of 19?19 lines (9x9 or 13x13
lines for easier flavors).

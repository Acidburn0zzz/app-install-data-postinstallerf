The refmac ligand dictionaries contain chemical information on a large
number of molecules, including the chemical structure of the ligand,
the tree-like structure, the links between ligands, and possible
modifications to them.  This information is stored in the mmCIF
format, which is used by a number of molecular viewing, refinement and
validation tools.

transcode is a text console video-stream processing tool. It supports
elementary video and audio frame transformations. Some example modules
are included to enable import of MPEG-1/2, Digital Video, and other
formats. It also includes export modules for writing to AVI files with
DivX, OpenDivX, XviD, Digital Video or other codecs. Direct DVD
transcoding is also supported. A set of tools is available to extract
and decode the sources into raw video/audio streams for import and to
enable post-processing of AVI files.

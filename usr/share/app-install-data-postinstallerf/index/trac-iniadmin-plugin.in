Comment3='
This plugin uses the new configuration option API in Trac 0.11+ to allow
modification of any field exposed through this mechanism.

This currently includes all core Trac settings, and although no plugins are
taking advantage of this yet, Im sure it will only be a matter of time )
Note Many Trac options require a restart of the server process, so your
changes may not take effect until that is done.

PermLib is a callable C++ library for permutation computations.
Currently it supports set stabilizer and in-orbit computations, based on
bases and strong generating sets (BSGS).  Additionally, it computes
automorphisms of symmetric matrices and finds the lexicographically
smallest set in an orbit of sets.

This package contains header files for developing programs that use
PermLib.

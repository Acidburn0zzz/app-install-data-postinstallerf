xwxapt is a GTK+ graphical version of wxapt. It uses the same decoding
engine as wxapt but it displays APT images at half-size as they are
received, storing the full-sized files when reception is completed.

It also displays some status information (audio level, sync level,
sync status etc) and text messages as it runs.

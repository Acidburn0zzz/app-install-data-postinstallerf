The Common Pipeline Library (CPL) comprises a set of ISO-C libraries
that provide a comprehensive, efficient and robust software toolkit.
It forms a basis for the creation of automated astronomical data-reduction
tasks (known as "pipelines") for ESO (European Southern Observatory)
instruments. The CPL was developed to standardize the way
VLT (Very Large Telescope) instrument pipelines are built,
to shorten their development cycle and to ease their maintenance.

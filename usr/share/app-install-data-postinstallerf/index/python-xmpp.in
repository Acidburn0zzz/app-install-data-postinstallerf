Comment3='
xmpppy is a Python library that is targeted to provide easy scripting
with Jabber. Similar projects are Twisted Words and jabber.py.

This library was not designed from scratch. It inherits some code from
jabberpy and have very similar API in many places. Though it is
separate project since it have almost completely different
architecture and primarily aims to work with jabberd2 - the new Open
Source Jabber Server.

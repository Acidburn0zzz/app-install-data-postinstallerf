The confproc collection comprises a class, a BibTeX style, and
some scripts for generating conference proceedings. It derives
from LaTeX scripts written for the DAFx-06 conference
proceedings, largely based on the pdfpages package for
including the proceedings papers and the hyperref package for
creating a proper table of contents, bookmarks and general
bibliography back-references. Confproc also uses many other
packages for fine tuning of the table of contents, bibliography
and index of authors. The added value of the class resides in
its time-saving aspects when designing conference proceedings.

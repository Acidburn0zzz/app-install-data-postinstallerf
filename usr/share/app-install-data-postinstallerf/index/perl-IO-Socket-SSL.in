This module is a true drop-in replacement for IOSocketINET that
uses SSL to encrypt data before it is transferred to a remote server
or client. IOSocketSSL supports all the extra features that one
needs to write a full-featured SSL client or server application
multiple SSL contexts, cipher selection, certificate verification, and
SSL version selection. As an extra bonus, it works perfectly with
mod_perl.

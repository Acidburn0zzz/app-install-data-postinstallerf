GraphEasy lets you generate graphs consisting of various shaped nodes
connected by edges (with optional labels). It can read and write graphs in a
variety of formats, as well as render them via its own grid-based layouter.
Since the layouter works on a grid (manhattan layout), the output is most
useful for flow charts, network diagrams, or hierarchy trees.

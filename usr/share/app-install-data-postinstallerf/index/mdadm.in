Comment3='
The mdadm program is used to create, manage, and monitor Linux MD (software
RAID) devices.  As such, it provides similar functionality to the raidtools
package.  However, mdadm is a single program, and it can perform
almost all functions without a configuration file, though a configuration
file can be used to help with some common tasks.

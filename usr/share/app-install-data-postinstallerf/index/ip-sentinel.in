Comment3='
IP Sentinel is a tool that tries to prevent unauthorized usage of
IP addresses within an ethernet broadcast domain by answering ARP
requests. After receiving faked replies, requesting parties store
the MAC in their ARP tables and will send future packets to this
invalid MAC, rendering the IP unreachable.

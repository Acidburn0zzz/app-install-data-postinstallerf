xdemorse is a GTK+ graphical version of demorse, using the same
decoding engine as demorse.

It has an FFT-derived "waterfall" display of the incoming audio signals
spectrum, as well as a scope-like display of the audio detectors output
and status of the mark/space discriminator ("slicer"). xdemorse also has
CAT for the FT-847 and this can be used to net the receivers frequency
to the incoming signal, by clicking near its trace in the waterfall display.

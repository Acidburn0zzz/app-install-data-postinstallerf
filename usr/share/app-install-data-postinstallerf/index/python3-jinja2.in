Jinja2 is a template engine written in pure Python.  It provides a
Django inspired non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and an
optional sandboxed environment.

If you have any exposure to other text-based template languages, such
as Smarty or Django, you should feel right at home with Jinja2. Its
both designer and developer friendly by sticking to Pythons
principles and adding functionality useful for templating
environments.

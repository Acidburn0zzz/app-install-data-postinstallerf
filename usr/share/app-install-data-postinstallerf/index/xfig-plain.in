Comment3='
Plain Xaw version of xfig, an X Window System tool for creating basic vector
graphics, including bezier curves, lines, rulers and more. The normal xfig
package uses the more modern / prettier looking Xaw3d toolkit, whereas this
version uses the very basic Xaw toolkit. Unless you really know you want this
version you probably dont want this version.

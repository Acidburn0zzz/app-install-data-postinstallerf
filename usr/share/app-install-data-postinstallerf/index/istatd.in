istatd is a daemon serving statistics to your iStat iPhone
application from Linux, Solaris & FreeBSD.
istatd collects data such as CPU, memory, network and disk
usage and keeps the history.
Once connecting from the iPhone and entering the lock code
this data will be sent to the iPhone and shown in fancy graphs.

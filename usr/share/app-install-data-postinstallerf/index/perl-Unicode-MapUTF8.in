Comment3='
UnicodeMapUTF8 Provides an adapter layer between core routines for
converting to and from UTF8 and other encodings. In essence, a way to
give multiple existing Unicode modules a single common interface so
you dont have to know the underlaying implementations to do simple
UTF8 to-from other character set string conversions. As such, it wraps
the UnicodeString, UnicodeMap8, UnicodeMap and Jcode modules in
a standardized and simple API.

krop is a simple graphical tool to crop the pages of PDF files. It is written
in Python and relies on PyQT, python-poppler-qt4 and pyPDF for its
functionality.

A unique feature of krop is its ability to automatically split pages into
subpages to fit the limited screen size of devices such as eReaders. This is
particularly useful, if your eReader does not support convenient scrolling.

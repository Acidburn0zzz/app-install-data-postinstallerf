gevent-socketio is a Python implementation of the Socket.IO
protocol, developed originally for Node.js by LearnBoost and then
ported to other languages.  Socket.IO enables real-time web
communications between a browser and a server, using a WebSocket-like
API.  One aim of this project is to provide a single gevent-based
API that works across the different WSGI-based web frameworks out
there (Pyramid, Pylons, Flask, web2py, Django, etc...).  Only ~3 lines
of code are required to tie-in gevent-socketio in your framework.

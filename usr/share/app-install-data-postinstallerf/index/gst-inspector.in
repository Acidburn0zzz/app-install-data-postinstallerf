GStreamer Inspector is an introspection data viewer for the GStreamer
multimedia framework. Developers of GStreamer applications can use it
to find out about the various elements available in the system.

It can be thought of as a graphical variant of the gst-inspect
program, which currently serves as the canonical source of
introspection information for many developers.

The libxslt-python package contains a module that permits applications
written in the Python programming language to use the interface
supplied by the libxslt library to apply XSLT transformations.

This library allows to parse sytlesheets, uses the libxml2-python
to load and save XML and HTML files. Direct access to XPath and
the XSLT transformation context are possible to extend the XSLT language
with XPath functions written in Python.

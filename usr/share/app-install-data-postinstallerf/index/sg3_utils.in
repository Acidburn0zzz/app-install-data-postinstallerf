Comment3='
Collection of Linux utilities for devices that use the SCSI command set.
Includes utilities to copy data based on "dd" syntax and semantics (called
sg_dd, sgp_dd and sgm_dd); check INQUIRY data and VPD pages (sg_inq); check
mode and log pages (sginfo, sg_modes and sg_logs); spin up and down
disks (sg_start); do self tests (sg_senddiag); and various other functions.
See the README, CHANGELOG and COVERAGE files. Requires the linux kernel 2.4
series or later. In the 2.4 series SCSI generic device names (e.g. /dev/sg0)
must be used. In the 2.6 series other device names may be used as
well (e.g. /dev/sda).

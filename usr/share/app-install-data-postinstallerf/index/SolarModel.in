Solar Model provides realtime modeling of the solar system. It allows the user
to navigate in space, to control time counting (speed-up time flow) and
estimate real movement of space bodies like planets, dwarf planets and moons;
estimate its nowadays positions in space. You may select two possible views
Solar System view or Milky Way galaxy view. It also allows the user to bind
the camera to space objects (for example, you can look from the Moon onto Earth
in real-time flow).

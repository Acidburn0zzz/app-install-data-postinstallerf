Geary is a new email reader for GNOME designed to let you read your
email quickly and effortlessly. Its interface is based on
conversations, so you can easily read an entire discussion without
having to click from message to message. Geary is still in early
development and has limited features today, but were planning to add
drag-and-drop attachments, lightning-fast searching, multiple account
support and much more. Eventually wed like Geary to have an
extensible plugin architecture so that developers will be able to add
all kinds of nifty features in a modular way.

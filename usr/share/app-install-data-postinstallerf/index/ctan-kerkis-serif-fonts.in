Kerkis type 1 fonts for LaTeX.  These fonts are particularly useful
for typesetting Greek. The Greek repertoire includes full support for
polytonic Greek, Greek numerals, and double forms of several letters
that occur in variant forms.
This package contains the Kerkis font family. It is based on the URW Bookman
font and extends it with Greek characters and math support.

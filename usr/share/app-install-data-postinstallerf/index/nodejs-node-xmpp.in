Idiomatic XMPP client, component and server library for Node.js.

The objectives of node-xmpp
 - Use Node.js conventions, especially EventEmitter (ie, for write buffer
   control)
 - Fast parsing; node-expat was written for this library
 - Client support for both XMPP clients and components
 - Optional server infrastructure with Router
 - After authentication, leave trivial protocol bits to the user, that is
   XML handling according to any XEP

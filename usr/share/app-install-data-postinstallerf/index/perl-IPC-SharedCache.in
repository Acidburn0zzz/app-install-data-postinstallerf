Comment3='
This module provides a shared memory cache accessed as a tied hash.
Shared memory is an area of memory that is available to all processes.
It is accessed by choosing a key, the ipc_key argument to tie.  Every
process that accesses shared memory with the same key gets access to
the same region of memory.  In some ways it resembles a file system,
but it is not hierarchical and it is resident in memory.  This makes
it harder to use than a filesystem but much faster.  The data in
shared memory persists until the machine is rebooted or it is
explicitly deleted.

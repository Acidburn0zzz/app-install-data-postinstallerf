Xplanet is similar to Xearth, where an image of the earth is rendered
into an X window.  Azimuthal, Mercator, Mollweide, orthographic, or
rectangular projections can be displayed as well as a window with a
globe the user can rotate interactively.  The other terrestrial
planets may also be displayed. The Xplanet home page has links to
locations with map files.

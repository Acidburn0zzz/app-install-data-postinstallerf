Comment3='
LogDispatchouli is a thin layer above LogDispatch and meant to make it
dead simple to add logging to a program without having to think much about
categories, facilities, levels, or things like that. It is meant to make
logging just configurable enough that you can find the logs you want and
just easy enough that you will actually log things.

Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG) is a software
development tool for connecting C, C++ and Objective C programs with a
variety of high-level programming languages.  SWIG is primarily used
with Perl, Python and Tcl/TK, but it has also been extended to Java,
Eiffel and Guile. SWIG is normally used to create high-level
interpreted programming environments, systems integration, and as a
tool for building user interfaces

UltimateStunts is a remake of the famous DOS-game Stunts. It was a 3D racing
game, with simple CGA/EGA/VGA graphics and no texture or smooth shading, but
because of the spectacular stunts (loopings, bridges to jump over, etc.)
it was really fun to play. One of the best aspects of this game is that it
had a track editor. Because of the tile-based tracks, every gamer was able
to make its own tracks. This remake works on UNIX-compatible systems (like
Linux), and on windows. It also provides more modern features, like openGL
graphics, 3D sound and internet multiplaying.

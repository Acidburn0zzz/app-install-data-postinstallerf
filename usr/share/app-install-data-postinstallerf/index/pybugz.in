Comment3='
Pybugz was conceived as a tool to speed up the work-flow for Gentoo Linux
contributors when dealing with bugs using Bugzilla.  By avoiding the clunky web
interface, the user can search, isolate and contribute to the project very
quickly.  Developers alike can easily extract attachments and close bugs
comfortably from the command line.

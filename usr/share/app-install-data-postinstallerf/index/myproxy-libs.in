MyProxy is open source software for managing X.509 Public Key Infrastructure
(PKI) security credentials (certificates and private keys). MyProxy
combines an online credential repository with an online certificate
authority to allow users to securely obtain credentials when and where needed.
Users run myproxy-logon to authenticate and obtain credentials, including
trusted CA certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).

Package myproxy-libs contains runtime libs for MyProxy.

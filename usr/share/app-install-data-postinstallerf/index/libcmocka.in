There are a variety of C unit testing frameworks available however many of them
are fairly complex and require the latest compiler technology. Some development
requires the use of old compilers which makes it difficult to use some unit
testing frameworks. In addition many unit testing frameworks assume the code
being tested is an application or module that is targeted to the same platform
that will ultimately execute the test. Because of this assumption many
frameworks require the inclusion of standard C library headers in the code
module being tested which may collide with the custom or incomplete
implementation of the C library utilized by the code under test.

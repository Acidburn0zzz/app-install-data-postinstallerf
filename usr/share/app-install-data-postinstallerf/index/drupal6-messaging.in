This is a Messaging Framework to allow message sending in a channel independent
way. It will provide a common API for message composition and sending while
allowing plug-ins for multiple messaging methods.

When using this framework, you wont send e-mails to users anymore. You will

that may be by mail, IM, SMS, depending on users preferences.

Unison is a multi-master file-synchronization tool. It allows two
replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored on
different hosts (or different locations on the same host), modified
separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the changes
in each replica to the other.

Note that this package contains Unison version 2.13, and
will never be upgraded to a different major version. Other packages
exist if you require a different major version.

MyBashBurn is a fork based on ncurses of the CD burning shell script
called BashBurn for Linux. It can burn bin/cue files, create ogg and
flac files, data, music and multisession CDs, as well as burn and create
ISO files, DVD-images, data DVDs and some other funny options.
MyBashBurn makes use of cdrecord and other back-end applications, so basically
if your writing device works with them, MyBashBurn will work flawlessly.

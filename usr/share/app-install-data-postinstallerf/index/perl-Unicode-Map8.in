Comment3='
The UnicodeMap8 class implements efficient mapping tables between
8-bit character sets and 16 bit character sets like Unicode.  About
170 different mapping tables between various known character sets and
Unicode is distributed with this package.  The source of these tables
is the vendor mapping tables provided by Unicode, Inc. and the code
tables in RFC 1345.  New maps can easily be installed.

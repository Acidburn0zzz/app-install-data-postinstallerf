UFO ALIEN INVASION is a strategy game featuring tactical combat
against hostile alien forces which are about to infiltrate earth at
this very moment. You are in command of a small special unit which
has been founded to face the alien strike force. To be successful on
the long run, you will also have to have a research team study the
aliens and their technologies in order to learn as much as possible
about their technology, their goals and the aliens themselves.

Vala is a new programming language that aims to bring modern programming
language features to GNOME developers without imposing any additional
runtime requirements and without using a different ABI compared to
applications and libraries written in C.

This package contains development files for vala-compat (API level
0.18). This is not necessary for using the vala-compat compiler.

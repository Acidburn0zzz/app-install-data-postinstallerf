dcaenc is a Free Software (LGPL-licensed) encoder for the DTS Coherent
Acoustics audio format. It may be useful if you want to create a DTS CD
or a DTS soundtrack for a DVD from a 6-channel PCM wav file using linux.
Another use case is related to real-time encoding of multichannel PCM
audio output from arbitrary linux applications for transmission over SPDIF.

The DTS technology is heavily patented. Please do not download and do not
use this software if you live in a country such as USA where software
patents are legal and you dont have a patent license from DTS, Inc.

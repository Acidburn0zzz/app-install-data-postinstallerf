libhugetlbfs is a library which provides easy access to huge pages of memory.
It is a wrapper for the hugetlbfs file system. Applications can use huge pages
to fulfill malloc() requests without being recompiled by using LD_PRELOAD.
Alternatively, applications can be linked against libhugetlbfs without source
modifications to load BSS or BSS, data, and text segments into large pages.

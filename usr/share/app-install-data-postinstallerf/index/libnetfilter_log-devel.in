libnetfilter_log is a userspace library providing interface to packets that
have been logged by the kernel packet filter. It is is part of a system that
deprecates the old syslog/dmesg based packet logging.

libnetfilter_log has been previously known as libnfnetlink_log.
libnetfilter_log is used by ulogd2.

Icecast is a streaming media server which currently supports Ogg Vorbis
and MP3 audio streams. It can be used to create an Internet radio
station or a privately running jukebox and many things in between.  It
is very versatile in that new formats can be added relatively easily and
supports open standards for commuincation and interaction.

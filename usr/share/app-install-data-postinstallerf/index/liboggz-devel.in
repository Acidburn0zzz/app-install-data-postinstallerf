Oggz provides a simple programming interface for reading and writing
Ogg files and streams. Ogg is an interleaving data container developed
by Monty at Xiph.Org, originally to support the Ogg Vorbis audio
format.

This package contains the header files and documentation needed for
development using liboggz.

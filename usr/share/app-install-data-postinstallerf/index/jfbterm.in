JFBTERM/ME takes advantages of framebuffer device that is
supported since linux kernel 2.2.x (at least on ix86 architecture)
and make it enable to display multilingual text on console.
It is developed on ix86 architecture, and it will works on
other architectures such as linux/ppc.

Features
   * It works with framebuffer device instead of VGA.
   * It supports pcf format font
   * It is not so fast because it doesnt take any advantages

Comment3='
Im sick of writing 00_load.t (or something like that) that will do use_ok()
for every module I write. Im sicker of updating 00_load.t when I add
another file to the distribution. This module reads MANIFEST to find modules
to be tested and does use_ok() for each of them. Now all you have to do is
update MANIFEST. You dont have to modify the test any more (hopefully).

Jupp is a compact and feature-rich WordStar-compatible editor and also the
MirOS fork of the JOE 3.x editor which provides easy conversion for former
PC users as well as powerfulness for programmers, while not doing annoying
things like word wrap "automagically". It can double as a hex editor and
comes with a character map plus Unicode support. Additionally it contains
an extension to visibly display tabs and spaces, has a cleaned up, extended
and beautified options menu, more CUA style key-bindings, an improved math
functionality and a bracketed paste mode automatically used with Xterm.

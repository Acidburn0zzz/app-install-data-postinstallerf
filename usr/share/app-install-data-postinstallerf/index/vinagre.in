Vinagre is a VNC client for the GNOME desktop.

With Vinagre you can have several connections open simultaneously, bookmark
your servers thanks to the Favorites support, store the passwords in the
GNOME keyring, and browse the network to look for VNC servers.
Apart from the VNC protocol, vinagre supports Spice and RDP.

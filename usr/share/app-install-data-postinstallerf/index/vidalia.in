Vidalia is a cross-platform controller GUI for Tor, built using the Qt
framework. Vidalia allows you to start and stop Tor, view the status of
Tor at a glance, and monitor Tors bandwidth usage. Vidalia also makes
it easy to contribute to the Tor network by helping you setup a Tor server,
if you wish.

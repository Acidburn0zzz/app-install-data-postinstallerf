The CodeDoc class is an alternative to DocStrip (and others) to
produce LaTeX code along with its documentation without
departing from LaTeXs ordinary syntax. The documentation is
prepared like any other LaTeX document and the code to be
commented verbatim is simply delimited by an environment. When
an option is turned on in the class options, this code is
written to the desired file(s). The class also includes fully
customizable verbatim environments which provide the author
with separate commands to typeset the material and/or to
execute it.

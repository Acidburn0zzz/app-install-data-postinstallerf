Comment3='
trademgen aims at providing a clean API, and the corresponding C++
implementation, able to generate demand for travel solutions (e.g.,
from JFK to PEK on 25-05-2009) according to characteristics (e.g.,
Willingness-To-Pay, preferred airline, etc).

trademgen makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for
increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular the
Boost (C++ Standard Extensions http//www.boost.org) library is used.
Install the trademgen package if you need a library of basic C++ objects

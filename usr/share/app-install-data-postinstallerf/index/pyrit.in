Comment3='
Pyrit exploits the computational power of many-core and GPGPU-platforms to
create massive databases, pre-computing part of the WPA/WPA2-PSK authentication
phase in a space-time trade-off. It is a powerful attack against one of the
worlds most used security-protocols.
Please note that this package only provides CPU support, GPUGPU support requires
CUDA or OpenCL, which have no Free Software implementations at this time.

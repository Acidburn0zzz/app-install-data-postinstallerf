Comment3='
Conduit is a solution to the streaming data problem, allowing for production,
transformation, and consumption of streams of data in constant memory.
It is an alternative to lazy I/O which guarantees deterministic resource
handling, and fits in the same general solution space as enumerator, iteratee,
and pipes.

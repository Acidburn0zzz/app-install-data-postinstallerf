Comment3='
Fixtures defines a Python contract for reusable state / support logic,
primarily for unit testing. Helper and adaption logic is included to
make it easy to write your own fixtures using the fixtures contract.
Glue code is provided that makes using fixtures that meet the Fixtures
contract in unittest compatible test cases easy and straight forward.

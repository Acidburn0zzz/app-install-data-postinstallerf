Apache Hadoop is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of
large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models.
It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each
offering local computation and storage.

The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is the primary storage system
used by Apache Hadoop applications.

Comment3='
The commands \import{full_path}{file} and
\subimport{path_extension}{file} set up input through standard
LaTeX mechanisms (\input, \include and \includegraphics) to
load files relative to the \import-ed directory. There are also
\includefrom, \subincludefrom, and * variants of the commands.

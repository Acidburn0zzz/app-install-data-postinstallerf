This TeX file provides various mechanisms (for plain TeX and
close relatives) to let insertions (footnotes, topins, pageins,
etc.) float within their appropriate section, but to prevent
them from intruding into the following section, even when
sections do not normally begin a new page. (If your sections
normally begin a new page, just use \supereject to flush out
insertions.)

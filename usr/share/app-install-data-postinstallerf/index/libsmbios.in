Libsmbios is a library and utilities that can be used by client programs to get
information from standard BIOS tables, such as the SMBIOS table.

This package provides the C-based libsmbios library, with a C interface.
This package also has a C++-based library, with a C++ interface. It is not
actively maintained, but provided for backwards compatibility. New programs
should use the libsmbios C interface.

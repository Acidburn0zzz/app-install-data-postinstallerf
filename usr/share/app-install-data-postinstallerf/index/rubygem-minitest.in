minitest/unit is a small and fast replacement for rubys huge and slow
test/unit. This is meant to be clean and easy to use both as a regular
test writer and for language implementors that need a minimal set of
methods to bootstrap a working unit test suite.

miniunit/spec is a functionally complete spec engine.
miniunit/mock, by Steven Baker, is a beautifully tiny mock object framework.

This package is an add-on to the MathTime a style to provide
TeX support for the use of the MathTime(tm) fonts (formerly
distributed by YandY, Inc.). The MathTime package has uppercase
Greek letters hardwired to be upright and only upright; this
package provides a switch to choose between the two kinds of
Greek uppercase letters.

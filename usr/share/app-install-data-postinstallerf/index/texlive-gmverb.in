Comment='<span size="xx-large">A variant of LaTeX \verb, verbatim and shortvrb</span>'
Comment3='
A redefinition of \verb and verbatim so that long lines are
breakable before \ and after { with % as hyphen. Allows you
to define your own verbatim-like environments (subject to a
size limit) and allows you to declare any single character as a
shorthand as in the \MakeShortVerb command of the shortvrb
package of the LaTeX distribution. The package depends on the
gmutils package.

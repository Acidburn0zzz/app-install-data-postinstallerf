makeself.sh is a shell script that generates a self-extractable
tar.gz archive from a directory. The resulting file appears as a shell
script, and can be launched as is. The archive will then uncompress
itself to a temporary directory and an arbitrary command will be
executed (for example an installation script). This is pretty similar
to archives generated with WinZip Self-Extractor in the Windows world.

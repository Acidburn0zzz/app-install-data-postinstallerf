This is a security component to prevent XML eXternal Entity (XXE) and
XML Entity Expansion (XEE) attacks on XML documents.

The XXE attack is prevented disabling the load of external entities in
the libxml library used by PHP, using the function libxml_disable_entity_loader.
The XEE attack is prevented looking inside the XML document for ENTITY usage.
If the XML document uses ENTITY the library throw an Exception.

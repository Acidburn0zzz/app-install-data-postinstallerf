Zinnia provides a simple, customizable, and portable dynamic OCR
system for hand-written input, based on Support Vector Machines.

Zinnia simply receives user pen strokes as coordinate data and outputs
the best matching characters sorted by SVM confidence. To maintain
portability, it has no rendering functionality. In addition to
recognition, Zinnia provides a training module capable of creating
highly efficient handwriting recognition models.
This package contains the shared libraries.

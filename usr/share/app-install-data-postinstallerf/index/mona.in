MONA is a tool that translates formulas in the logics WS1S or WS2S into
finite-state automata represented by BDDs.  The formulas may express search
patterns, temporal properties of reactive systems, parse tree constraints,
etc.  MONA also analyses the automaton resulting from the compilation, and
determines whether the formula is valid and, if the formula is not valid,
generates a counterexample.

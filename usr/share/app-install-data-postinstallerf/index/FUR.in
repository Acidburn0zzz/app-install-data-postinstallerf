FUR is an application that let the user mount a Windows CE based device on your
Linux file system it uses the brilliant FUSE and the librapi2 of the Synce
Project (a *nix implementation of the RAPI protocol that your device uses to
communicate with your other operating system) to give you the illusion that the
storage of your Pocket PC is a directory on your local filesystem.

The games are based in a boys? school and revolved around the antics of Eric,
the hero.

In Skool Daze, Eric must steal his report card from the school safe - the
combination of which must be extracted from the teachers? brains using flashing
shields or, in the case of the history teacher, post-hypnotic suggestion.
In Back to Skool, Eric must get his report card back into the school safe,
this time with the extra help provided by a water pistol, stink-bombs, a bike,
mice, a frog and a girlfriend.

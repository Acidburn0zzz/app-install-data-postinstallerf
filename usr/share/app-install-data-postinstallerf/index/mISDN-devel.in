Comment3='
mISDN (modular ISDN) is intended to be the new ISDN stack for the
Linux 2.6 kernel, from the maintainer of the existing isdn4linux
code. This package contains the development files for userspace
libraries required to interface to mISDN, needed for compiling
applications which use mISDN directly such as OpenPBX.

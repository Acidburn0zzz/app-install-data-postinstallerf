Mojomojo is a content management system, borrowing many concepts from wikis and
blogs. It allows you to maintain a full tree-structure of pages, and to
interlink them in various ways. It has full version support, so you can always
go back to a previous version and see whats changed with an easy diff system.
There are also some useful features like live AJAX preview while editing,
tagging, built-in full-text search, image galleries, and RSS feeds for every
wiki page.

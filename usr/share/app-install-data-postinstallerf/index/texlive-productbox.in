The package enables typesetting of a three-dimensional product
box. This product box can be rendered as it is standing on a
surface and some light is shed onto it. Alternatively it can be
typeset as a wireframe to be cut out and glued together. This
will lead to a physical product box. The package requires the
package pgf and TikZ.

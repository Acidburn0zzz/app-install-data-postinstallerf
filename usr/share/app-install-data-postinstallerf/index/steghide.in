Steghide is a steganography program that is able to hide data in various kinds
of image- and audio-files. The color- respectivly sample-frequencies are not
changed thus making the embedding resistant against first-order statistical
tests. Features of steghide include compression and encryption of embedded
data,

embedding of a checksum to verify the integrity of the extracted data and
support for jpeg, bmp, wav and au files.

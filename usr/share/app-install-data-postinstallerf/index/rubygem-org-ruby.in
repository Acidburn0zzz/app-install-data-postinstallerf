Comment3='
An org-mode parser written in Ruby. This gem contains Ruby routines for
parsing org-mode files. The most significant thing this library does
today is convert org-mode files to HTML or textile. Currently, you
cannot do much to customize the conversion. The supplied textile
conversion is optimized for extracting "content" from the orgfile as
opposed to "metadata."

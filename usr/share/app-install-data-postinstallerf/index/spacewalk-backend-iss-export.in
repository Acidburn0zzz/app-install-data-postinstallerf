spacewalk-backend contains the basic code that provides server/backend
functionality for a variety of XML-RPC receivers. The architecture is
modular so that you can plug/install additional modules for XML-RPC
receivers and get them enabled automatically.

This package contains listener for the Server XML dumper.

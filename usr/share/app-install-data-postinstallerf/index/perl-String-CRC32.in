This packages provides a perl module to generate checksums from strings and
from files.

The checksums are the same as those calculated by ZMODEM, PKZIP, PICCHECK and
many others.
Theres another perl module called StringCRC, which supports calculation of
CRC values of various widths (i.e. not just 32 bits), but the generated sums
differ from those of the programs mentioned above.

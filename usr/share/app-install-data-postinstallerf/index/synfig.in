Synfig is a powerful, industrial-strength vector-based 2D animation
software, designed from the ground-up for producing feature-film quality
animation with fewer people and resources.  It is designed to be capable of
producing feature-film quality animation. It eliminates the need for
tweening, preventing the need to hand-draw each frame. Synfig features
spatial and temporal resolution independence (sharp and smoothat any
resolution or framerate), high dynamic range images, and a flexible plugin
system.

This package contains the command-line-based rendering backend.

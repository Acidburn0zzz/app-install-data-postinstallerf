pst-osci is a PSTricks package enables you to produce
oscilloscope "screen shots". Three channels can be used to
represent the most common signals (damped or not) namely
sinusoidal, rectangular, triangular, dogs tooth (left and
right oriented). The third channel allows you to add, to
subtract or to multiply the two other signals. Lissajous
diagrams (XY-mode) can also be obtained.

This class is the parent for all access methods supported by the WWWSearch
library. This library implements a Perl API to web-based search engines. See
README for a list of search engines currently supported, and for a lot of
interesting high-level information about this distribution. Search results can
be limited, and there is a pause between each request to avoid overloading
either the client or the server.

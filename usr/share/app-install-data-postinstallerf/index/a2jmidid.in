Comment3='
a2jmidid is a project that aims to ease usage of legacy ALSA sequencer
applications, in a JACK MIDI enabled system. There are two ways to use legacy
ALSA sequencer applications in JACK MIDI system.

The first approach is to use automatic bridging. For every ALSA sequencer port
you get one JACK MIDI port. If ALSA sequencer port is both input and output
one, you get two JACK MIDI ports, one input and output.
The second approach is to static bridges. You start application that creates
one ALSA sequencer port and one JACK MIDI port. Such bridge is unidirectional.

Comment3='
Provides fonts (in both MetaFont and Adobe Type 1 format) based
on the capitals carved on the Trajan column in Rome in 114 AD,
together with macros to access the fonts. Many typographers
think these rank first among the Romans artistic legacy. The
font is uppercase letters together with some punctuation and
analphabetics; no lowercase or digits.

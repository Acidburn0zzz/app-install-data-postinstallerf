NorduGrid is a collaboration aiming at development, maintenance and
support of the free Grid middleware, known as the Advanced Resource
Connector (ARC).

This package contains the ARC cache service. It provides a way to perform
some operations on the A-REX cache remotely. It can be especially helpful
for data management within a pilot job framework.

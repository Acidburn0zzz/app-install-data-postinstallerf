Comment3='
Pekwm is a window manager that once up on a time was based on the aewm++ window
manager, but it has evolved enough that it no longer resembles aewm++ at all.
It has a much expanded feature-set, including window grouping (similar to ion,
pwm, or fluxbox), autoproperties, xinerama, keygrabber that supports keychains,
and much more.

* Lightweight and Unobtrusive, a window manager shouldnt be noticed.
* Very configurable, we all work and think in different ways.
* Automatic properties, for all the lazy people, make things appear as they
should when starting applications.

Comment3='
This library is for working with ".tar" archive files. It
can read and write a range of common variations of archive
format including V7, USTAR, POSIX and GNU formats. It provides
support for packing and unpacking portable archives.
This makes it suitable for distribution but not backup
because details like file ownership and exact permissions
are not preserved.

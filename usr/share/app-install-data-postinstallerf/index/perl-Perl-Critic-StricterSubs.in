As a dynamic language, Perl doesnt require you to define subroutines until
run-time. Although this is a powerful feature, it can also be a major
source of bugs. For example, you might mistype the name of a subroutine, or
call a subroutine from another module without including that module or
importing that subroutine. And unless you have very good test coverage, you
might not know about these bugs until you have already launched your code.

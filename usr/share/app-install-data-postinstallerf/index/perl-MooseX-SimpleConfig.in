Comment3='
This role loads simple configfiles to set object attributes. It is based on
the abstract role MooseXConfigFromFile, and uses ConfigAny to load your
configfile. ConfigAny will in turn support any of a variety of different
config formats, detected by the file extension. See ConfigAny for more
details about supported formats.

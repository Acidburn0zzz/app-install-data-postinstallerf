Comment3='
The workerpool module for python 3 is a simple framework for easily
distributing jobs into multiple worker threads.  Examples of usage can be
found in the unit tests and the samples provided.  This module facilitates
distributing simple operations into jobs that are sent to worker threads,
maintained by a pool object.

It consists of these components
* Jobs - single units of work that need to be performed.
* Workers - workers grab jobs from a queue and run them.

Comment3='
fakeroot runs a command in an environment wherein it appears to have
root privileges for file manipulation. fakeroot works by replacing the
file manipulation library functions (chmod(2), stat(2) etc.) by ones
that simulate the effect the real library functions would have had,
had the user really been root.

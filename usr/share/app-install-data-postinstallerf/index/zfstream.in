zfstream is a small C++ library which provides an abstraction API for reading
and writing compressed and non-compressed files using the same API. It supports
libz and libbz2 compression schemes. The library is trivial to use and provides
client applications with a unified interface for reading and writing files
without having to know whether they are compressed or not.

FreeCAD is a general purpose Open Source 3D CAD/MCAD/CAx/CAE/PLM modeler, aimed
directly at mechanical engineering and product design but also fits a wider
range of uses in engineering, such as architecture or other engineering
specialties. It is a feature-based parametric modeler with a modular software
architecture which makes it easy to provide additional functionality without
modifying the core system.

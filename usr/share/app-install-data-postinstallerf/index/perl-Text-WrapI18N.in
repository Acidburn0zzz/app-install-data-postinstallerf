This is a module which intends to substitute TextWrap,
which supports internationalized texts including
 - multi-byte encodings such as UTF-8, EUC-JP, EUC-KR, GB2312, and Big5,
 - full width characters like east Asian characters which appear in
   UTF-8, EUC-JP, EUC-KR, GB2312, Big5, and so on,
 - combining characters like diacritical marks which appear in UTF-8,
   ISO-8859-11 (aka TIS-620), and so on, and
 - languages which dont use white spaces between words, like Chinese
   and Japanese.

This is a Node.js module for parsing form data, especially file uploads.
It was developed for Transloadit, a service focused on uploading and encoding
images and videos.

It offers
 - Fast (~500mb/sec), non-buffering multipart parser
 - Automatically writing file uploads to disk
 - Low memory footprint
 - Graceful error handling
 - Very high test coverage

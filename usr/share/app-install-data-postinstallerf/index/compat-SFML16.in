SFML is a portable and easy to use multimedia API written in C++. You can see
it as a modern, object-oriented alternative to SDL.
SFML is composed of several packages to perfectly suit your needs. You can use
SFML as a minimal windowing system to interface with OpenGL, or as a
fully-featured multimedia library for building games or interactive programs.

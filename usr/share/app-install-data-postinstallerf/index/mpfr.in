The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point
computations with "correct rounding". The MPFR is efficient and
also has a well-defined semantics. It copies the good ideas from the
ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision floating-point arithmetic
(53-bit mantissa). MPFR is based on the GMP multiple-precision library.

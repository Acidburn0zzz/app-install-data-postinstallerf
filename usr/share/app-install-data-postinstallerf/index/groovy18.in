Groovy is an agile and dynamic language for the Java Virtual Machine,
built upon Java with features inspired by languages like Python, Ruby and
Smalltalk.  It seamlessly integrates with all existing Java objects and
libraries and compiles straight to Java byte-code so you can use it anywhere
you can use Java.

Comment='<span size="xx-large">Simplified Spanish support for Babel</span>'
Comment3='
The package provides very simplified (or ultra sloppy) support
for Spanish in Babel, mostly as a fallback in case spanish.ldf
fails for some reason. The package provides basic support for
Spanish hyphenation, captions, date, frenchspacing,
indentfirst, symbolic footnotes, enumerations, small caps roman
numerals, and a handful of shorthands and Spanish mathematical
operators. No options or attributes for customization are
provided.

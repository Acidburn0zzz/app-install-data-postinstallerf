The Apache Lucene engine is a powerful, feature-rich Java search engine that is
flexible about document storage and supports many complex query
types. Zend_Search_Lucene is a port of this engine written entirely in PHP 5.

* allows PHP-powered websites to leverage powerful search capabilities without
  the need for web services or Java
* provides binary compatibility with Apache Lucene
* matches Apache Lucene in performance

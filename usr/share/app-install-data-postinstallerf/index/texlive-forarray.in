The package provides functionality for processing lists and
array structures in LaTeX. Arrays can contain characters as
well as TeX and LaTeX commands, nesting of arrays is possible,
and arrays are processed within the same brace level as their
surrounding environment. Array levels can be delimited by
characters or control sequences defined by the user. Practical
uses of this package include data management, construction of
lists and tables, and calculations based on the contents of
lists and arrays.

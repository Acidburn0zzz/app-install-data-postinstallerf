The Staden I/O library provides a general purpose interface for reading and
writing trace files and other bioinformatics experiment files.  The programmer
simply calls, for example, the read_reading function to create a "Read" C
structure with the data loaded into memory.  It has been compiled and tested
on a variety of Unix systems, MacOS X and MS Windows.

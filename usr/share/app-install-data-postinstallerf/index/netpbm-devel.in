The netpbm-devel package contains the header files and static libraries,
etc., for developing programs which can handle the various graphics file
formats supported by the netpbm libraries.

Install netpbm-devel if you want to develop programs for handling the
graphics file formats supported by the netpbm libraries.  Youll also need
to have the netpbm package installed.

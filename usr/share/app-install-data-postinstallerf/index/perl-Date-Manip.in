DateManip is a series of modules designed to make any common date/time
operation easy to do. Operations such as comparing two times, determining a
data a given amount of time from another, or parsing international times
are all easily done. It deals with time as it is used in the Gregorian
calendar (the one currently in use) with full support for time changes due
to daylight saving time.

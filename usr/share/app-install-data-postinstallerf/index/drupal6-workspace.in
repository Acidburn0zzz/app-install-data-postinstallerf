Each user has his/her own workspace, which is accessible by following a
"My workspace" link in the main site navigation, just like the
"My account" link. The workspace interface is tabbed (in the Drupal
6.x version) and shows Content, Comments, and Attachments (attachments
are files the user has uploaded with Drupal cores upload module).

Comment3='
aterm, version 1.00 is a colour vt102 terminal emulator, based on
rxvt 2.4.8 with Alfredo Kojima?s additions of fast transparency,
intended as an xterm(1) replacement for users who do not require fea-
tures such as Tektronix 4014 emulation and toolkit-style configurabil-
advantage on a machine serving many X sessions.

Comment3='
The DSPAM agent masquerades as the email servers local delivery agent
and filters/learns spams using an advanced Bayesian statistical approach
(based on Bayes theorem of combined probabilities) which provides an
administratively maintenance-free, easy-learning Anti-Spam service
custom tailored to each individual users behavior. Advanced because on
top of standard Bayesian filtering is also incorporated the use of
Chained Tokens, de-obfuscation, and other enhancements. DSPAM works
great with Sendmail, Exim and Postfix, and should work well with any
other MTA that supports an external local delivery agent (qmail, etc.)

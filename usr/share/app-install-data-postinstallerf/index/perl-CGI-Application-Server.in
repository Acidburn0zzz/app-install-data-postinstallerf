Comment3='
This is a simple HTTP server for for use during development with
CGIApplication. At this moment, it serves our needs in a very basic way.
The plan is to release early and release often, and add features when we
need them. That said, we welcome any and all patches, tests and feature
requests (the ones with which are accompanied by failing tests will get
priority).

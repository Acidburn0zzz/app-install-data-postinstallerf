The game memorize is about finding matching pairs. A pair can consist of any
multimedia object. At the moment these are images, sounds and text but this
could be extended to animations or movie snippets as well. Which pairs do
match is up to the creator of the game. Memorize is actually more than just
a predefined game you can play, it allows you to create new games yourself
as well.

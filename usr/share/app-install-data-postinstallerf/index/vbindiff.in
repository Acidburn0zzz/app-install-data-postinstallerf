VBinDiff (Visual Binary Diff) displays files in hexadecimal
and ASCII (or EBCDIC). It can also display two files at once,

of the ProSel utilities by Glen Bredon, for the Apple II.
The single-file mode was inspired by the LIST utility
of 4DOS and friends. While less provides a good line-oriented display,

Comment3='
This package provides a higher-level interface over threads, in which an
"Async a" is a concurrent thread that will eventually deliver a value of
type "a". The package provides ways to create "Async" computations,
wait for their results, and cancel them.

Using Async is safer than using threads in two ways
* When waiting for a thread to return a result, if the thread dies with an
exception then the caller must either re-throw the exception (wait) or handle
it (waitCatch); the exception cannot be ignored.

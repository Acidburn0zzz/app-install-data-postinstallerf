"firehose" is a Python package intended for managing the results from
code analysis tools (e.g. compiler warnings, static analysis, linters,
etc).

It currently provides parsers for the output of gcc, clang-analyzer and
cppcheck.  These parsers convert the results into a common data model of
Python objects, with methods for lossless roundtrips through a provided
XML format.  There is also a JSON equivalent.

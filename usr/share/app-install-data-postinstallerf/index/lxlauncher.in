LXLauncher is designed as an open source replacement for the Asus Launcher
included in their EeePC. It is desktop-independent and follows
freedesktop.org specs, so newly added applications will automatically show
up in the launcher, and vice versa for the removed ones.
LXLauncher is part of LXDE, the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment.

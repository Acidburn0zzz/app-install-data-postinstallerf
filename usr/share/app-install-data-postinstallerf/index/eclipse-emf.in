The Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) allows developers to build tools and
other applications based on a structured data model. From a model
specification described in XMI, EMF provides tools and runtime support to
produce a set of Java classes for the model, along with a set of adapter
classes that enable viewing and command-based editing of the model, and a
basic editor.

Comment3='
Gdbm-devel contains the development libraries and header files for
gdbm, the GNU database system.  These libraries and header files are
necessary if you plan to do development using the gdbm database.

Install compat-gdbm-devel if you are developing C programs which will
use older version of gdbm database library.  Youll also need to install
the compat-gdbm package.

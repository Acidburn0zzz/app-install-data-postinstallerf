Ruby/AWS is a Ruby language library that allows the programmer to retrieve
information from Amazon via the Associate Web Service. In addition to the
original amazon.com site, amazon.co.uk, amazon.de, amazon.fr, amazon.ca and
amazon.co.jp are also supported.

In addition to wrapping the AWS API, Ruby/AWS provides geolocation of clients,
transparent fetching of all hits for a given search (not just the first 10)
and a host of other features.
Ruby/AWS supersedes Ruby/Amazon.

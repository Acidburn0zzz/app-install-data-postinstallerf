The BEDTools utilities allow one to address common genomics tasks such
as finding feature overlaps and computing coverage. The utilities are
largely based on four widely-used file formats BED, GFF/GTF, VCF, and
SAM/BAM. Using BEDTools, one can develop sophisticated pipelines that
answer complicated research questions by "streaming" several BEDTools
together.

Gdbm is a GNU database indexing library, including routines which use
extensible hashing.  Gdbm works in a similar way to standard UNIX dbm
routines.  Gdbm is useful for developers who write C applications and
need access to a simple and efficient database or who are building C
applications which will use such a database.

If youre a C developer and your programs need access to simple
database routines, you should install gdbm.  Youll also need to
install gdbm-devel.

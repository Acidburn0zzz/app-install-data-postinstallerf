The Toolkit for Multivariate Analysis (TMVA) provides a
ROOT-integrated environment for the parallel processing and
evaluation of MVA techniques to discriminate signal from background
samples. It presently includes (ranked by complexity)

  * Rectangular cut optimization
  * Correlated likelihood estimator (PDE approach)
  * Multi-dimensional likelihood estimator (PDE - range-search approach)
  * Fisher (and Mahalanobis) discriminant
  * H-Matrix (chi-squared) estimator

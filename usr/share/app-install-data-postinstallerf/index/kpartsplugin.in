This software implements a plug-in for Netscape-compatible browsers in a Unix
environment. This plug-in uses KDEs KParts technology to embed file viewers
(e.g. for PDF files) into non-KDE browsers. Tested browsers include both
Mozilla Firefox and Opera.
With this plug-in, you can e.g. view PDF files in Firefox using Okular as an
embedded plug-in.

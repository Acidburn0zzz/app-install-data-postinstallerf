OpenThreads is intended to provide a minimal & complete Object-Oriented (OO)
thread interface for C++ programmers.  It is loosely modeled on the Java
thread API, and the POSIX Threads standards.  The architecture of the
library is designed around "swappable" thread models which are defined at
compile-time in a shared object library.

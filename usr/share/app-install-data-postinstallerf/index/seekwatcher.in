Comment3='
Seekwatcher generates graphs from blktrace runs to help visualize IO patterns
and performance. It can plot multiple blktrace runs together, making it easy
to compare the differences between different benchmark runs.

You should install the seekwatcher package if you need to visualize detailed
information about IO patterns.

Comment3='
check-mk is a general purpose Nagios-plugin for retrieving data. It adopts a
new approach for collecting data from operating systems and network components.
It obsoletes NRPE, check_by_ssh, NSClient, and check_snmp and it has many
benefits, the most important are a significant reduction of CPU usage on
the Nagios host and an automatic inventory of items to be checked on hosts.

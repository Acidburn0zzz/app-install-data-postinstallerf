The package extends the ocg package, which allows you to create
OCGs (Optional Content Groups) in PDF documents. (The ocg
package is distributed as part of Asymptote.) Every OCG
includes TeX material into a layer of the PDF file. Each of
these layers can be displayed or not. Links can enable or
disable the display of OCGs. The ocgx package does not use
Javascript embedded in the PDF document to enable (to show) or
disable (to hide) OCGs.

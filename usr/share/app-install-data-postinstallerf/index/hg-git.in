Comment3='
This is the Hg-Git plugin for Mercurial, adding the ability to push and pull
to/from a Git server repository from Hg. This means you can collaborate on Git
based projects from Hg, or use a Git server as a collaboration point for a team
with developers using both Git and Hg. It can also convert commits/changesets
losslessly from one system to another, so you can push via an Hg repository
and another Hg client can pull it and their changeset node ids will be
identical - Mercurial data does not get lost in translation.

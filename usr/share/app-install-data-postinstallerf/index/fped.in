fped is an editor that allows the interactive creation of footprints of
electronic components. Footprint definitions are stored in a text format
that resembles a programming language.

The language is constrained such that anything that can be expressed in
the textual definition also has a straightforward equivalent operation
that can be performed through the GUI.

Installing this package sets up the xguest user to be used as a temporary
account to switch to or as a kiosk user account. The account is disabled unless
SELinux is in enforcing mode. The user is only allowed to log in via graphical login program.
The home and temporary directories of the user will be polyinstantiated and
mounted on tmpfs.

ANTLRWorks is a novel grammar development environment for ANTLR v3 grammars
written by Jean Bovet (with suggested use cases from Terence Parr). It combines
an excellent grammar-aware editor with an interpreter for rapid prototyping and
a language-agnostic debugger for isolating grammar errors. ANTLRWorks helps
eliminate grammar nondeterminisms, one of the most difficult problems for
beginners and experts alike, by highlighting nondeterministic paths in the
syntax diagram associated with a grammar. ANTLRWorks goal is to make grammars
more accessible to the average programmer, improve maintainability and
readability of grammars by providing excellent grammar navigation and
refactoring tools, and address the most common questions and problems

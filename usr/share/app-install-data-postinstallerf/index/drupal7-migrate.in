The migrate module provides a flexible framework for migrating content into
Drupal from other sources (e.g., when converting a web site from another
CMS to Drupal). Out-of-the-box, support for creating core Drupal objects
such as nodes, users, and comments is included - it can easily be extended
for migrating other kinds of content. Content is imported and rolled back
using Drush commands.

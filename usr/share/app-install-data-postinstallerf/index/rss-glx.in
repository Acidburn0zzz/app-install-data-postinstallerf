Comment3='
A port of the Really Slick Screensavers to GLX. Provides several visually
impressive and graphically intensive screensavers.

Note that this package contains only the display hacks themselves; you will
need to install the appropriate subpackage for your desktop environment in
order to use them as screensavers.

Comment3='
Titanium is a more user-friendly packaging of the mature CGIApplication
framework and some useful plugins, with the intention of creating a strong
but lightweight web application framework. It runs well in a plain CGI
environment and provides excellent performance in a persistent environment
such as FastCGI or mod_perl.

Tool that provides a demonstration of HTTPS stripping attacks that were
presented at Black Hat DC 2009 by Moxie Marlinspike. It will transparently
hijack HTTP traffic on a network, watch for HTTPS links and redirects, then map
those links into either look-alike HTTP links or homograph-similar HTTPS links.
It also supports modes for supplying a favicon which looks like a lock icon,
selective logging, and session denial

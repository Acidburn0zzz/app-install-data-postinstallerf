This package contains the pure Python implementation of gensim.
If you dont need the highly optimized version of word2vec, it is
sufficient to install this package.  Otherwise installing the
"python-gensim-addons"-package is strongly recommended.

Gensim is a Python library for topic modelling, document indexing
and similarity retrieval with large corpora.  Target audience is
the natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval
(IR) community.

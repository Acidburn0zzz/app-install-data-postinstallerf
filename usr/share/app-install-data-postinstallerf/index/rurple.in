With the assistance of a robot named Reeborg, one can explore
the fun of programming in the Python language.
A "Python Learning Environment" is a Python implementation of
a "robot environment" as introduced by R. Pattis in 1981.
RUR is similar in spirit to GvR, although it uses Python syntax.
It also includes a Python shell.

Comment3='
mkelfImage is a program that makes a elf boot image for linux kernel images.
The image should work with any i386 multiboot compliant boot loader, an ELF
boot loader that passes no options, a loader compliant with the linuxBIOS elf
booting spec or with the linux kexec kernel patch.  A key feature here is that
nothing relies upon BIOS calls, but they are made when necessary.  This is
useful for systems running linuxbios.

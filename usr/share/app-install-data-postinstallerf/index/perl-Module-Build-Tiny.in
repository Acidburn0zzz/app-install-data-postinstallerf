Comment3='
Many Perl distributions use a Build.PL file instead of a Makefile.PL file to
drive distribution configuration, build, test and installation. Traditionally,
Build.PL uses ModuleBuild as the underlying build system. This module
provides a simple, lightweight, drop-in replacement.

Whereas ModuleBuild has over 6,700 lines of code; this module has less than
70, yet supports the features needed by most pure-Perl distributions.

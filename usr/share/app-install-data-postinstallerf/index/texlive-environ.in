The package provides the \collect@body command (as in amsmath),
as well as a \long version \Collect@Body, for collecting the
body text of an environment. These commands are used to define
a new author interface to creating new environments. For
example \NewEnviron{test} wraps the entire environment body in
square brackets, doing the right thing in ignoring leading and
trailing spaces.

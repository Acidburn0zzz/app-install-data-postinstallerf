TermShellUI is a Perl module, which tries to make every feature that
one would expect to see in a fully interactive shell trivial to implement.
It uses the history and autocompletion features of TermReadLine to present
a sophisticated command-line interface to the user. You simply declare your
command set and let ShellUI take care of the heavy lifting.

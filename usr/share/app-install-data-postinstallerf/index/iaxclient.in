Comment3='
Iaxclient is an open source, multiplatform library for creating telephony
solutions that interoperate with Asterisk, the Open Source PBX.

Although asterisk supports other VOIP protocols (including SIP, and with
patches, H.323), IAXs simple, lightweight nature gives it several advantages,
particularly in that it can operate easily through NAT and packet firewalls,
and it is easily extensible and simple to understand.
Iaxclient pulls together the wide array of open source technologies required
for telephony applications.

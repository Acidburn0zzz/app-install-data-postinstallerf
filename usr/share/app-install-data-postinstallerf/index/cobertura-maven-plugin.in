This plugin provides the features of Cobertura within the Maven 2 & 3
environment. The report generated by this plugin is the result of executing
the Cobertura tool against your compiled classes to help you determine
how well the unit testing efforts have been, and can then be used to identify
which parts of your Java program are lacking test coverage.

A Latin typeface published by Hirwen Harendals Arkandis Digital Foundry,
Accanthis was inspired from the ?Cloister Oldstyle? typeface found in the
?American Specimen Book of Typefaces Suplement?. Its medium contrast is
sufficient to be reader-friendly and deliver an elegant and refined experience.
Its creator considers it as a ?modernized? garaldic typeface.
Accanthis is well suited to book typesetting and refined presentations.

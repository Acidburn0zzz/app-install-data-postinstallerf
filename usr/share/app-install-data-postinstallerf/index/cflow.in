GNU cflow analyzes a collection of C source files and prints a graph,
charting control flow within the program.

GNU cflow is able to produce both direct and inverted flowgraphs for C
sources. Optionally a cross-reference listing can be generated. Two
output formats are implemented POSIX and GNU (extended).

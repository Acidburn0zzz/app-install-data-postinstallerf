StGit is a Python application providing similar functionality
to Quilt (i.e. pushing/popping patches to/from a stack) on top of Git.
These operations are performed using Git commands and the patches
are stored as Git commit objects, allowing easy merging of the StGit patches
into other repositories using standard Git functionality.

Note that StGit is not an SCM interface on top of Git and it expects
a previously initialized Git repository. For standard SCM operations,
either use plain Git commands or the Cogito tool.

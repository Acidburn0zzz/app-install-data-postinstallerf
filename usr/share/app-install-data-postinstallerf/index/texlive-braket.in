Comment3='
Provides macros to typeset bra-ket notation, as well as set
specifiers, with a single ("|") or a double ("||" or ("\|")
vertical bar specifier in between two bracketed parts. Each
macro comes in a fixed-size version and an expanding version.
If the package finds itself operating under e-tex, it uses the
extended primitive \middle for more reliable results

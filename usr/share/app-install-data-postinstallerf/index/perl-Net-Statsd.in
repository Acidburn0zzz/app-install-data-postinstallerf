This module implements a client for a statsd statistics collection server, such
as the one in use at Etsy.com.

You want to use this module to track statistics in your Perl application, such
as how many times a certain event occurs (user logins in a web application, or
database queries issued), or you want to time and then graph how long certain
events take, like database queries execution time or time to download a certain
file, etc...

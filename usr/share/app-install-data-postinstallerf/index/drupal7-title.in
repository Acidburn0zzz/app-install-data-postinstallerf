While working on the new content translation system
(http//api.drupal.org/api/group/field_language/7) for Drupal 7, we (the Drupal
core i18n team) faced the need to convert node titles to the Field API in order
to make nodes fully translatable.

We were not able to make this happen in Drupal 7 core so we decided to find a
solution for this in contrib the idea is replacing node titles with fields ?
la Automatic Nodetitles (http//drupal.org/project/auto_nodetitle).
This will be exploited by the related Entity Translation

The overall goal of this project is to make mobile devices featuring the OBEX
protocol and adhering to the OBEX FTP standard accessible by an open source
implementation. The common usage for ObexFTP is to access your mobile phones
memory to store and retrieve e.g. your phonebook, logos, ringtones, music,
pictures and alike.

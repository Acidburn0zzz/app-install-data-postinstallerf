GUILE (GNUs Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extension) is a library
implementation of the Scheme programming language, written in C.  GUILE
provides a machine-independent execution platform that can be linked in
as a library during the building of extensible programs.

Install the guile package if youd like to add extensibility to programs
that you are developing.

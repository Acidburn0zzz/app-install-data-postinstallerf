Adjtimex provides raw access to kernel time variables. On standalone
or intermittently connected machines, root can use adjtimex to correct
for systematic drift. If your machine is connected to the Internet or
is equipped with a precision oscillator or radio clock, you should
instead manage the system clock with the xntpd program. Users can use
adjtimex to view kernel time variables.

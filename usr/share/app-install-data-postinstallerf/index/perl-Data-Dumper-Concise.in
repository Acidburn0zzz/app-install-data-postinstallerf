This module always exports a single function, Dumper, which can be
called with an array of values to dump those values or with no arguments
to return the DataDumper object it has created.  It exists,
fundamentally, as a convenient way to reproduce a set of Dumper options
that weve found ourselves using across large numbers of applications.

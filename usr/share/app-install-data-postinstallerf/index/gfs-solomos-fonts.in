From the middle of the 19th century an italic font with many calligraphic
overtones was introduced into Greek printing. Its source is unknown, but it
almost certainly was the product of a German or Italian foundry. In the first
type specimen printed in Greece by the typecutter K. Miliadis (1850), the font
was listed anonymously along others of 11pts and in the Gr. Doumas undated
specimen appeared as ?11pt Greek inclined?. For most of the second half of the
century the type was used extensively as an italic for emphasis in words,
sentences or exerpts. In 1889, the folio size Type Specimen of Anestis
Konstantinidis publishing, printing and type founding establishment also
included the type as ?Greek inclined [9 & 12 pt]?.

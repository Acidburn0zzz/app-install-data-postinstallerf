Docking windows allow the user to reorganize the applications workspace
according to his needs

	* Drag and Drop parts of the application ("Dockables")
	* Hide the dockables not often used to save screen space
	* Detach some dockables and have them floating outside the window
	* Easily switch between different workspaces
	* And much more...

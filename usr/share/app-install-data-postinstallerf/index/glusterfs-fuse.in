GlusterFS is a clustered file-system capable of scaling to several
petabytes. It aggregates various storage bricks over Infiniband RDMA
or TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file
system. GlusterFS is one of the most sophisticated file systems in
terms of features and extensibility.  It borrows a powerful concept
called Translators from GNU Hurd kernel. Much of the code in GlusterFS
is in user space and easily manageable.

This package provides support to FUSE based clients.

Prosper is a LaTeX class for writing transparencies. It is
written as an extension of the seminar class by Timothy Van
Zandt. Prosper offers a friendly environment for creating
slides for both presentations with an overhead projector and a
video projector. Slides prepared for a presentation with a
computer and a video projector may integrate animation effects,
incremental display, and so on. Various visual styles are
supported (including some that mimic PowerPoint) and others are
being contributed.

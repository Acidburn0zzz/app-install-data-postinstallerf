Record is the basic rich-media capture activity for the laptop. It
lets you capture still images, video, and/or audio. It has a simple
interface and works in both laptop and ebook mode. An interface for
sharing pictures among multi XOs during a picture-taking session is
a hallmark of the Record activity

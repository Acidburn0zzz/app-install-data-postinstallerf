Arcade-style shoot-em-up where you can choose a type of ship and depending on
the type of ship can pickup a number of upgrades during the game.

Lacewing is an arcade-style shoot-em-up which plays a little bit like a cross
between Spacewar and Centipede. It has a decidedly retro style to it. It has
a single-player mode, and also co-operative and duel modes for two players
(split-screen).

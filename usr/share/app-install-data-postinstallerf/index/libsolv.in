Comment3='
A free package dependency solver using a satisfiability algorithm. The
library is based on two major, but independent, blocks

- Using a dictionary approach to store and retrieve package
  and dependency information.
- Using satisfiability, a well known and researched topic, for
  resolving package dependencies.

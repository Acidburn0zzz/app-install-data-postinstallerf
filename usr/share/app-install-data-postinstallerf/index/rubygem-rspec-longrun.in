RSpec is a fine unit-testing framework, but is also handy for acceptance
and integration tests.  But the default report formatters make it difficult
to track progress of such long-running tests.

The RSpecLongrunFormatter outputs the name of each test as it starts,
rather than waiting until it passes or fails.  It also provides a mechanism
for reporting on progress of a test while it is still executing.

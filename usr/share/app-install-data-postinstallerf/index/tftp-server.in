Comment3='
The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is normally used only for
booting diskless workstations.  The tftp-server package provides the
server for TFTP, which allows users to transfer files to and from a
remote machine. TFTP provides very little security, and should not be
enabled unless it is expressly needed.  The TFTP server is run from
/etc/xinetd.d/tftp, and is disabled by default.

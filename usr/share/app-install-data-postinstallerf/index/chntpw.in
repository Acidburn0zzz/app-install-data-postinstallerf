This is a utility to (re)set the password of any user that has a valid
(local) account on your Windows NT/2k/XP/Vista etc system. You do not
need to know the old password to set a new one. It works offline, that
is, you have to shutdown your computer and boot off a floppydisk or CD
or another system. Will detect and offer to unlock locked or disabled
out user accounts! There is also a registry editor and other registry
utilities that works under linux/unix, and can be used for other things
than password editing.

Based on the roman of Frederic Goudys Kennerley Old Style (designed and cut in
1911 for a limited edition of "The Door in the Wall and Other Stories" by H G
Wells, published by Mitchell Kennerley). The letters, though not condensed, may
seem to fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, giving text an unusually
solid appearance.

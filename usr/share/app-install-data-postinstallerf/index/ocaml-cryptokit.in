The Cryptokit library for Objective Caml provides a variety of
cryptographic primitives that can be used to implement cryptographic
protocols in security-sensitive applications. The primitives provided
include

* Symmetric-key cryptography AES, DES, Triple-DES, ARCfour, in ECB,
  CBC, CFB and OFB modes.
* Public-key cryptography RSA encryption and signature; Diffie-Hellman
  key agreement.
* Hash functions and MACs SHA-1, SHA-256, RIPEMD-160, MD5, and MACs

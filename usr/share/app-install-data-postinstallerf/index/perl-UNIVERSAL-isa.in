Whenever you use "isa" in UNIVERSAL as a function, a kitten using
TestMockObject dies. Normally, the kittens would be helpless, but
if they use UNIVERSALisa (the module whose docs you are reading),
the kittens can live long and prosper.

This module replaces UNIVERSALisa with a version that makes sure
that if its called as a function on objects which override isa,
isa will be called on those objects as a method.
In all other cases the real UNIVERSALisa is just called directly.

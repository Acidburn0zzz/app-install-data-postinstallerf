CoverageTestRunner is a Python module for running unit tests and
failing them if the unit test module does not exercise all statements
in the module it tests.

For example, unit tests in module foo_tests.py are supposed to test
everything in the foo.py module, and if they dont, its a bug in the
test coverage. It does not matter if other tests happen to test the
missing parts. The unit tests for the module should test everything in
that module.

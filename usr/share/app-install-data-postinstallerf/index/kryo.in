Comment3='
Kryo is a fast and efficient object graph serialization framework for Java.
The goals of the project are speed, efficiency, and an easy to use API.
The project is useful any time objects need to be persisted, whether to a
file, database, or over the network.

Kryo can also perform automatic deep and shallow copying/cloning.
This is direct copying from object to object, not object->bytes->object.

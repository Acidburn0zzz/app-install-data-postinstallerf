Libguestfs is a library for accessing and modifying guest disk images.
Amongst the things this is good for making batch configuration
changes to guests, getting disk used/free statistics (see also
virt-df), migrating between virtualization systems (see also
virt-p2v), performing partial backups, performing partial guest
clones, cloning guests and changing registry/UUID/hostname info, and
much else besides.

Libguestfs uses Linux kernel and qemu code, and can access any type of
guest filesystem that Linux and qemu can, including but not limited

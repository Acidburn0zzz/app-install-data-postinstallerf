Conduit is a synchronization solution for GNOME which allows the user to take
their emails, files, bookmarks, and any other type of personal information and
synchronize that data with another computer, an online service, or even another
electronic device.

Conduit manages the synchronization and conversion of data into other formats.
For example, conduit allows you to;
 * Synchronize your tomboy notes to a file on a remote computer
 * Synchronize your emails to your mobile phone

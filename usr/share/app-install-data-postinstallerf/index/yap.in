Comment3='
A high-performance Prolog compiler developed at LIACC, Universidade do
Porto. The Prolog engine is based in the WAM (Warren Abstract
Machine), with several optimizations for better performance. YAP
follows the Edinburgh tradition, and is largely compatible with the
ISO-Prolog standard and with Quintus and SICStus Prolog.

  WebCalendar is a PHP-based calendar application that can be configured as a
single-user calendar, a multi-user calendar for groups of users, or as an
event calendar viewable by visitors. MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, DB2,
Interbase, MS SQL Server, or ODBC is required.
  WebCalendar can be setup in a variety of ways, such as...
	* A schedule management system for a single person
	* A schedule management system for a group of people, allowing one or
	  more assistants to manage the calendar of another user
	* An events schedule that anyone can view, allowing visitors to submit
	  new events

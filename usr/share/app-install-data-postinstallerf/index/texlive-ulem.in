Comment3='
The package provides an \ul (underline) command which will
break over line ends; this technique may be used to replace \em
(both in that form and as the \emph command), so as to make
output look as if it comes from a typewriter. The package also
offers double and wavy underlining, and striking out (line
through words) and crossing out (/// over words). The package
works with both Plain TeX and LaTeX.

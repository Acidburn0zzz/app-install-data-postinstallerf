The strace program intercepts and records the system calls called and
received by a running process.  Strace can print a record of each
system call, its arguments and its return value.  Strace is useful for
diagnosing problems and debugging, as well as for instructional
purposes.

Install strace if you need a tool to track the system calls made and
received by a process.

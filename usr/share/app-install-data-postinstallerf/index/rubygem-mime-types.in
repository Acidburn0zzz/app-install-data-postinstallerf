MIMETypes for Ruby manages a MIME Content-Type database that will return the
Content-Type for a given filename.

MIMETypes was originally based on and synchronized with MIMETypes for
Perl by Mark Overmeer, copyright 2001 - 2009. As of version 1.15, the data
format for the MIMEType list has changed and the synchronization will no
longer happen.

Comment3='
stress is not a benchmark, but is rather a tool designed to put given
subsytems under a specified load. Instances in which this is useful
include those in which a system administrator wishes to perform tuning
activities, a kernel or libc programmer wishes to evaluate denial of
service possibilities, etc.

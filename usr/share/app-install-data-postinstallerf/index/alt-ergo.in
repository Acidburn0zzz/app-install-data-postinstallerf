Alt-Ergo is an automated theorem prover implemented in OCaml. It is
based on CC(X) - a congruence closure algorithm parameterized by an
equational theory X. This algorithm is reminiscent of the Shostak
algorithm. Currently CC(X) is instantiated by the theory of linear
arithmetics. Alt-Ergo also contains a home made SAT-solver and an
instantiation mechanism by which it fully supports quantifiers.

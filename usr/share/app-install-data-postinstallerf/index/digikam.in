digiKam is an easy to use and powerful digital photo management application,
which makes importing, organizing and manipulating digital photos a "snap".
An easy to use interface is provided to connect to your digital camera,
preview the images and download and/or delete them.

digiKam built-in image editor makes the common photo correction a simple task.
The image editor is extensible via plugins, can also make use of the KIPI image
handling plugins to extend its capabilities even further for photo
manipulations, import and export, etc. Install the kipi-plugins packages
to use them.

Comment3='
rake-compiler aims to help Gem developers while dealing with
Ruby C extensions, simplifiying the code and reducing the duplication.

It follows *convention over configuration* and set an standarized
structure to build and package C extensions in your gems.
This is the result of expriences dealing with several Gems
that required native extensions across platforms and different
user configurations where details like portability and
clarity of code were lacking.

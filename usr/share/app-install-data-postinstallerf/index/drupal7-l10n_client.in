This module helps you fix translations on your site as you see the issues.
Just by navigating around your pages, youll be able to fix translations and
fill in missing ones using the on-page translation editor. At the same time,
if configured properly, the module also submits your translations back to the
community, to localize.drupal.org (http//localize.drupal.org/) or any other
localization server.

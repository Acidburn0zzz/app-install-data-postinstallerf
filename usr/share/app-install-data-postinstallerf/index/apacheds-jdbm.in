A specific JDBM Implementation.
A JDBM entry store which does not have any dependency on
core interfaces. The JDBM partition will use this store
and build on it to adapt this to server specific partition
interfaces. Having this separate module without
dependencies on core interfaces makes it easier to avoid
cyclic dependencies between modules. This is especially
important for use within the bootstrap plugin which needs
to build the schema partition used for bootstrapping the
server.

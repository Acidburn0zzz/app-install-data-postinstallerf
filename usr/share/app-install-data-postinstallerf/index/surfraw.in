Surfraw provides a fast unix command line interface to a variety of
popular WWW search engines and other artifacts of power. It reclaims
google, altavista, babelfish, dejanews, freshmeat, research index,
slashdot and many others from the false-prophet, pox-infested heathen
lands of html-forms, placing these wonders where they belong, deep in
unix heartland, as god loving extensions to the shell.

Surfraw abstracts the browser away from input. Doing so lets it get on
with what its good at. Browsing. Interpretation of linguistic forms
is handed back to the shell, which is what it, and human beings are

The PT Sans family was developed as part of the ?Public Types of Russian
Federation? project. This project aims at enabling the peoples of Russia to
read and write their native languages, using free/libre fonts. It is
dedicated to the 300-year anniversary of the Russian civil type invented by
Peter the Great from 1708 to 1710, and was realized with financial support
from the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications.
The fonts include support for all 54 title? languages of the Russian
Federation as well as more common Western, Central European and Cyrillic

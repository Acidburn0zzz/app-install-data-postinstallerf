Comment3='
The dev86 package provides an assembler and linker for real mode 80x86
instructions. Youll need to have this package installed in order to
build programs that run in real mode, including LILO and the kernels
bootstrapping code, from their sources.

You should install dev86 if you intend to build programs that run in real
mode from their source code.

This library provides an object-oriented programming interface for developing
games and other visually-rich applications with Python 3.
pyglet has virtually no external dependencies. For most applications and game
requirements, pyglet needs nothing else besides Python, simplifying
distribution and installation. It also handles multiple windows and
fully aware of multi-monitor setups.

pyglet might be seen as an alternative to PyGame.

libCEC allows you in combination with the right hardware to control your device
with your TV remote control over your existing HDMI cabling.

libCEC is an enabling platform for the CEC bus in HDMI, it allows developers to
interact with other HDMI devices without having to worry about the communication
overhead, handshaking, and the various ways of send messages for each vendor.

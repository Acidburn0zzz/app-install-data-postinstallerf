VIM (VIsual editor iMproved) is an updated and improved version of the
vi editor.  Vi was the first real screen-based editor for UNIX, and is
still very popular.  VIM improves on vi by adding new features
multiple windows, multi-level undo, block highlighting and more.  The
vim-common package contains files which every VIM binary will need in
order to run.

If you are installing vim-enhanced or vim-X11, youll also need
to install the vim-common package.

Comment3='
This package adds additional initialization functionality to Shorewall in two
ways. It allows the firewall to be closed prior to bringing up network
devices. This insures that unwanted connections are not allowed between the
time that the network comes up and when the firewall is started. It also
integrates with NetworkManager and distribution ifup/ifdown systems to allow
for event-driven startup and shutdown.

Comment3='
The numexpr package evaluates multiple-operator array expressions many
times faster than NumPy can. It accepts the expression as a string,
analyzes it, rewrites it more efficiently, and compiles it to faster
Python code on the fly. It?s the next best thing to writing the
expression in C and compiling it with a specialized just-in-time (JIT)
compiler, i.e. it does not require a compiler at runtime.

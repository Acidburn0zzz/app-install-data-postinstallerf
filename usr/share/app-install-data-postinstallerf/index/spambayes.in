SpamBayes will attempt to classify incoming email messages as spam, ham
(good, non-spam email) or unsure. This means you can have spam or unsure
messages automatically filed away in a different mail folder, where it wont
interrupt your email reading. First SpamBayes must be trained by each user to
identify spam and ham. Essentially, you show SpamBayes a pile of email that
you like (ham) and a pile you dont like (spam). SpamBayes will then analyze
the piles for clues as to what makes the spam and ham different. For example;
different words, differences in the mailer headers and content style.  The
system then uses these clues to examine new messages.

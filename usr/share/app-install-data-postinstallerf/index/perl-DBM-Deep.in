Comment='<span size="xx-large">A pure perl multi-level hash/array DBM</span>'
Comment3='
A unique flat-file database module, written in pure perl. True multi-level
hash/array support (unlike MLDBM, which is faked), hybrid OO / tie()
interface, cross-platform FTPable files, and quite fast. Can handle
millions of keys and unlimited hash levels without significant slow-down.
C-based DBM. Out-of-the-box compatibility with Unix, Mac OS X and Windows.

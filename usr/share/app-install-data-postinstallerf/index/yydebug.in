Comment3='
jay/yydebug supports tracing and animation for a Java-based parser generated
by jay. An implementation of yyDebug is passed as an additional argument to
yyparse() to trace a Java-based parser generated by jay with option -t set.
yyDebugAdapter produces one-line messages, by default to standard output.
The messages are designed to be filtered by a program such as grep. yyAnim
provides an animation of the parsing process

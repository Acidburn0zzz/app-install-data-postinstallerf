This library implements arithmetic and logical operations over
arbitrary-precision integers.

The module is simply named "Z".  Its interface is similar to that of the
Int32, Int64 and Nativeint modules from the OCaml standard library, with
some additional functions.  See the file z.mlip for documentation.
The implementation uses GMP (the GNU Multiple Precision arithmetic
library) to compute over big integers.  However, small integers are
represented as unboxed Caml integers, to save space and improve

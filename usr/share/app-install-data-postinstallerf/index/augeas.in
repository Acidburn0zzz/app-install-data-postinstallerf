Comment3='
A library for programmatically editing configuration files. Augeas parses
configuration files into a tree structure, which it exposes through its
public API. Changes made through the API are written back to the initially
read files.

The transformation works very hard to preserve comments and formatting
details. It is controlled by ``lens definitions that describe the file
format and the transformation into a tree.

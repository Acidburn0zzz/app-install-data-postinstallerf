Comment3='
Argtable is an ANSI C library for parsing GNU style command line
arguments. It enables a programs command line syntax to be defined in
the source code as an array of argtable structs. The command line is
then parsed according to that specification and the resulting values
are returned in those same structs where they are accessible to the main
are supported, as are multiple instances of each argument.
Syntax error handling is automatic.

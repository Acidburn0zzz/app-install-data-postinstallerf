The SvxLink server is a general purpose voice services system for ham radio
use. Each voice service is implemented as a plugin called a module.
Some examples of voice services are Help system, Simplex repeater,
EchoLink communications and voice mail.

The core of the system handle the radio interface and is quite flexible
as well. It can act both as a simplex node and as a repeater controller. It is
also possible to link multiple receivers in via TCP/IP. The best receiver is
chosen using a software voter.

Pages of a document processed with the booklet package will be
reordered and scalled so that they can be printed as four pages
per physical sheet of paper, two pages per side. The resulting
sheets will, when folded in half, assemble into a booklet.
Instructions on producing the manual itself as a booklet are
included.

PicoSAT solves the SAT problem, which is the classical NP complete
problem of searching for a satisfying assignment of a propositional
formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF).  PicoSAT can generate proofs
and cores in memory by compressing the proof trace.  It supports the
proof format of TraceCheck.

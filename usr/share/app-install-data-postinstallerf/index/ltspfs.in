Fuse based remote filesystem for LTSP thin clients
 LtspFS is a remote filesystem consisting of two parts
 1) A network server daemon that runs on the LTSP terminal.
 2) A FUSE module that runs in userspace on the server, that connects with
 the daemon on the client.
 This package contains the userspace parts for the LTSP server.

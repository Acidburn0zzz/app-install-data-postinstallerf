Comment3='
Whenjobs is a powerful but simple cron replacement.

Two key advantages over cron are a simpler syntax for writing rules
and a powerful dependency system that lets one job depend on variables
set when other jobs run (allowing, for example, one job to run only
when another job has finished successfully).

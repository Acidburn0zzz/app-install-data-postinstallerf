This package provides a way to insert fixme notes in documents
being developed (in draft mode). Such notes can appear in the
margin of the document, as index entries, in the log file and
as warnings on stdout. It is also possible to summarize them in
a list. If your document is in a final version, any remaining
fixme notes will produce an error. FiXme also comes with
support for AUC-TeX.

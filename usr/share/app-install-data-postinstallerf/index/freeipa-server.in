IPA is an integrated solution to provide centrally managed Identity (machine,
user, virtual machines, groups, authentication credentials), Policy
(configuration settings, access control information) and Audit (events,
logs, analysis thereof). If you are installing an IPA server you need
to install this package (in other words, most people should NOT install
this package).

Comment3='
This module provides a way to process XML documents. It is build on
top of XMLParser.  XMLTwig offers a tree interface to the
document, while allowing you to output the parts of it that have been
completely processed.  It allows minimal resource (CPU and memory)
usage by building the tree only for the parts of the documents that
need actual processing, through the use of the twig_roots and
twig_print_outside_roots options.

Paver is a Python-based build/distribution/deployment scripting tool along the
lines of Make or Rake. What makes Paver unique is its integration with commonly
used Python libraries. Common tasks that were easy before remain easy. More
importantly, dealing with your applications specific needs and requirements is
now much easier.

* Build files are just Python
* One file with one syntax, pavement.py, knows how to manage your project
* File operations are unbelievably easy, thanks to the built-in version of
  Jason Orendorff?s path.py.

js_of_ocaml is a compiler of OCaml byte-code to JavaScript.
It makes it possible to run OCaml programs in a web browser.
Its key features are the following
 * the whole language, and most of the standard library are
   supported;
 * the generated code can be used with any web server and browser;
 * you can use a standard installation of OCaml to compile your
   programs. In particular, you do not have to recompile a library to
   use it with Js_of_ocaml. You just have to link your program with a
   specific library to interface with the browser APIs.

Implode is a logic game based on the "falling block" model of Tetris. The game
starts with a grid partially filled with blocks. The player makes a move by
removing adjacent blocks of the same color in groups of three or more. When
blocks are removed, higher blocks fall to fill their space, and when a column
is cleared, the blocks on either side close to fill the gap. The object of the
game is to remove all the blocks. Since the patterns of blocks above changes
when lower blocks are removed, the player must carefully decide what order
in which to remove the blocks so that there are no isolated blocks left at
the end of the game. The levels are generated in such a way that there is
always a sequence of removals that clears the board.

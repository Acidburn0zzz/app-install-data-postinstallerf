The zimlib is the standard implementation of the ZIM specification. It is a
library which implements the read and write method for ZIM files. Use zimlib in
your own software - like reader applications - to make them ZIM-capable without
the need having to dig too much into the ZIM file format. zimlib is written in
C++. It also includes the binaries zimsearch and zimdump, for directly
searching and viewing ZIM file contents.

Comment3='
This library is an effort to provide a free collision detection library for
generic polyhedra. Its purpose is mainly for 3D games where accurate detection
is needed between two non-simple objects.

Features
    * Works on any model, even polygon soups.
    * Uses bounding box hierarchies for fast detection.
    * Uses additional triangle intersection tests for 100% accuracy.
    * Provides (upon request) exact point of collision, plus the pair of
      triangles that collided.

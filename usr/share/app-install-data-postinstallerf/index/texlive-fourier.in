Fourier-GUTenberg is a LaTeX typesetting system which uses
Adobe Utopia as its standard base font. Fourier-GUTenberg
provides all complementary typefaces needed to allow Utopia
based TeX typesetting, including an extensive mathematics set
and several other symbols. The system is absolutely stand-
alone apart from Utopia and Fourier, no other typefaces are
required. The fourier fonts will also work with Adobe Utopia
Expert fonts, which are only available for purchase. Utopia is
a registered trademark of Adobe Systems Incorporated

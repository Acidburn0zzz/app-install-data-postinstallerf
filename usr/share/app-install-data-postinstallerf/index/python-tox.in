Tox as is a generic virtualenv management and test command line tool you
can use for

 - checking your package installs correctly with different Python versions
   and interpreters
 - running your tests in each of the environments, configuring your test tool
   of choice
 - acting as a frontend to Continuous Integration servers, greatly reducing
   boilerplate and merging CI and shell-based testing.

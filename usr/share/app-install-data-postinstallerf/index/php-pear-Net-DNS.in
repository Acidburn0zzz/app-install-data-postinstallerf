Comment3='
A resolver library used to communicate with a name server to perform DNS
queries, zone transfers, dynamic DNS updates, etc. Creates an object
hierarchy from a DNS server response, which allows you to view all of
the information given by the DNS server. It bypasses the system
resolver library and communicates directly with the server.

Comment3='
The hfsutils-devel package provides a C library for low-level access
to Macintosh volumes. HFS (Hierarchical File System) is the native
volume format found on modern Macintosh computers.  The C library can
be linked with other programs to allow them to manipulate Macintosh
files in their native format.  Other HFS accessing utilities, which
are comparable to mtools, are included in the hfsutils package.

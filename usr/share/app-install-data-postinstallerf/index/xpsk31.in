Comment3='
xpsk31 is a GTK+ graphical version of lpsk31, using the same basic signal
decoding and encoding engine but controlled by the user via the GUI. In
addition it has a FFT-derived "waterfall" display of the incoming signal and a
"magniphase" display that shows the magnitude, phase and frequency error of the
psk31 signal.

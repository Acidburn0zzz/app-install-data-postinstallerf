A package for typesetting scholarly critical editions,
replacing the established ledmac package. Ledmac itself was a
LaTeX port of the plain TeX EDMAC macros. The package supports
indexing by page and by line numbers, and simple tabular- and
array-style environments. The package is distributed with the
related eledpar package.

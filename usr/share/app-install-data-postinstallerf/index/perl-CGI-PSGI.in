This module is for web application framework developers who currently uses
CGI to handle query parameters. You can switch to use CGIPSGI instead of
CGI, to make your framework compatible to PSGI with a slight modification
of your framework adapter. The framework should already be collecting the
body content to print at one place, and not printing any content directly
to STDOUT.

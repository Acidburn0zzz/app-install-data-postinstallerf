This module is a variation on the lovely TextDiff module. Rather than
generating traditional line-oriented diffs, however, it generates word-
oriented diffs. This can be useful for tracking changes in narrative
documents or documents with very long lines. To diff source code, one is
still best off using TextDiff. But if you want to see how a short
story changed from one version to the next, this module will do the job
very nicely.

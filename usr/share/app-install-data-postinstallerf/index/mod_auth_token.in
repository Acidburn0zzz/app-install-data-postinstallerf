mod_auth_token allow you to generate URIS for a determined time window,
you can also limit them by IP. This is very useful to handle file
downloads, generated URIS cant be hot-linked (after it expires), also
it allows you to protect very large files that cant be piped trough a
script languages due to memory limitation.

MythTV provides a unified graphical interface for recording and viewing
television programs.  Refer to the mythtv package for more information.

This package contains only the client software, which provides a
front-end for playback and configuration.  It requires access to a
mythtv-backend installation, either on the same system or one
reachable via the network.

id3v2 is a command line tool to add, modify, remove, or view ID3v2
tags, as well as convert or list ID3v1 tags.  ID3 tags are commonly
embedded in compressed music files and are the standard way to more
fully describe the work than would normally be allowed by putting the
information in the filename.

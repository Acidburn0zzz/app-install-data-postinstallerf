Blackboard variants of Computer Modern fonts. The fonts are
distributed as MetaFont source (only); LaTeX support is
available with the bbm-macros package. The Sauter font package
has MetaFont parameter source files for building the fonts at
more sizes than you could reasonably imagine. A sample of these
fonts appears in the blackboard bold sampler.

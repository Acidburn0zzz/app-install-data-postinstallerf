QtDMM is a DMM readout software including a configurable recorder.
The recorder features manual start, scheduled start (at a given time),
triggered automatic start when given thresholds are reached, and the
ability to display more than one value from the multimeter.
It was written for Metex (and compatible like VOLTCRAFT) multimeter
which use an 14 byte protocol. Later several more protocols have been added.
For more information on the currently supported DMMs have a look at
the preset table.

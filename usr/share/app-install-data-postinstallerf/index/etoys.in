Squeak Etoys was inspired by LOGO, PARC-Smalltalk, Hypercard, and starLOGO. It
is a media-rich authoring environment with a simple powerful scripted object
model for many kinds of objects created by end-users that runs on many
platforms, and is free and open source. It includes 2D and 3D graphics, images,
text, particles, pres-entations, web-pages, videos, sound and MIDI, etc. It
includes the ability to share desktops with other Etoy users in real-time, so
many forms of immersive mentoring and play can be done over the Internet.

(La)TeX macros for typesetting guitar chords over song texts.
The toolbox package is required. Note that this package only
places arbitrary TeX code over the lyrics. To typeset the
chords graphically (and not only by name), the author
recommends use of an additional package such as gchords by K.
Peeters.

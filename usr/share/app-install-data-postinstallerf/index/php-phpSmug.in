Comment3='
phpSmug is an award winning PHP wrapper class for the SmugMug API
written and maintained by Colin Seymour. The intention of this class
is to allow PHP application developers to quickly and easily interact
with the SmugMug API in their applications, without having to worry
about the finer details of the API.  phpSmug is based on the great
work of Dan Coulter in phpFlickr.

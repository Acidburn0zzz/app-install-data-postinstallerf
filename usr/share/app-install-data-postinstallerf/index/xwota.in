Xwota is intended for amateur radio operators who want to make use of the WOTA
database.

It can be used to find out who is on the air, the band and frequency they are
operating on, and their location by country, state, county, grid, and
latitude/longitude
Its very similar to a DX Cluster client, but it works with the WOTA database
and contains more informations.

GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of elements which
operate on media data.

gstreamer-plugins-bad contains plug-ins that arent
tested well enough, or the code is not of good enough quality.
This package (gstreamer-plugins-bad-extras) contains extra "bad" plugins for
sources (mythtv), sinks (fbdev) and effects (pitch) which are not used
very much and require additional libraries to be installed.

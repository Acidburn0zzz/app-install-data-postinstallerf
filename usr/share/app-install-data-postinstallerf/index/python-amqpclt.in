amqpclt is a versatile tool to interact with messaging brokers speaking AMQP
and/or message queues (see messaging.queue) on disk.

It receives messages (see messaging.message) from an incoming module,
optionally massaging them (i.e. filtering and/or modifying), and sends
them to an outgoing module. Depending on which modules are used, the tool
can perform different operations.

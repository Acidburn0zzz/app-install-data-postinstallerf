Comment3='
Coarse locking daemon for cloud computing.  This software provides
a cache-coherent, highly-available distributed file system for small
files.

CLDs primary uses include consensus service (election of a master,
with fail-over, also known as lock service), reliable name space,
and reliable small file storage.

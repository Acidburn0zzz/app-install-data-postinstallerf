HawtDispatch is a small (less than 100k) thread pooling and
NIO event notification framework API modeled after the
libdispatch API that Apple created to power the Grand Central
Dispatch (GCD) technology in OS X. It allows you to easily develop
multi-threaded applications without having to deal with the
problems that traditionally plague multi-threaded application
development.

This package provides the libdispatch style API for Java.

passwdqc is a password/passphrase strength checking and policy
enforcement toolset, including a PAM module (pam_passwdqc), command-line
programs (pwqcheck and pwqgen), and a library (libpasswdqc).

pam_passwdqc is normally invoked on password changes by programs such as
passwd(1).  It is capable of checking password or passphrase strength,
enforcing a policy, and offering randomly-generated passphrases, with
all of these features being optional and easily (re-)configurable.
pwqcheck and pwqgen are standalone password/passphrase strength checking

Comment3='
iowatcher generates graphs from blktrace runs to help visualize IO patterns and
performance as SVG images or movies. It can plot multiple blktrace runs
together, making it easy to compare the differences between different benchmark
runs.

You should install the iowatcher package if you need to visualize detailed
information about IO patterns.

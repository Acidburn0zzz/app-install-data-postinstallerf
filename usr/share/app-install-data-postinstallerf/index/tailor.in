Tailor is a tool to migrate changesets between CVS, Subversion, git,
darcs, monotone, Codeville, Mercurial and Baazar-NG repositories.

This script makes it easier to keep the upstream changes merged in
a branch of a product, storing needed information such as the upstream
URI and revision in special properties on the branched directory.

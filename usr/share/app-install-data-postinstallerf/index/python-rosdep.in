rosdep is a command-line tool for installing system dependencies. For
end-users, rosdep helps you install system dependencies for software that
you are building from source. For developers, rosdep simplifies the problem
of installing system dependencies on different platforms. Instead of having to
figure out which Debian package on Ubuntu Oneiric contains Boost, you can just
specify a dependency on boost.

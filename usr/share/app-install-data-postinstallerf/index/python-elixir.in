Comment3='
Elixir is a declarative layer on top of SQLAlchemy. It is a fairly thin
wrapper, which provides the ability to define model objects following the
Active Record design pattern, and using a DSL syntax similar to that of the
Ruby on Rails ActiveRecord system.

Elixir does not intend to replace SQLAlchemys core features, but instead
focuses on providing a simpler syntax for defining model objects when you do
not need the full expressiveness of SQLAlchemys manual mapper definitions.

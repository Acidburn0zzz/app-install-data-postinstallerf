AdPlug is a free software, cross-platform, hardware independent AdLib
sound player library, mainly written in C++ and released under the
LGPL. AdPlug plays sound data, originally created for the AdLib (OPL2)
audio board, directly from its original format on top of an OPL2
emulator or by using the real hardware. No OPL chip is required for
playback. It supports various audio formats from MS-DOS AdLib trackers.

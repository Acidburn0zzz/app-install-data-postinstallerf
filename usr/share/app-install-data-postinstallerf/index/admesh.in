ADMesh is a program for diagnosing and/or repairing commonly encountered
problems with STL (STereo Lithography) data files. It can remove degenerate
and unconnected facets, connect nearby facets, fill holes by adding facets,
and repair facet normals. Simple transformations such as scaling,
translation and rotation are also supported. ADMesh can read both
ASCII and binary format STL files, while the output can be in
AutoCAD DXF, Geomview OFF, STL, or VRML format.

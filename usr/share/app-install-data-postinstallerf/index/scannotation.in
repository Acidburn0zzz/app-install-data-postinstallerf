Scannotation is a Java library that creates an annotation database
from a set of .class files.This database is really just a set of maps that index
what annotations are used and what classes are using them. Why do you need this?
What if you are an annotation framework like an EJB 3.0 container and you want
to automatically scan your classpath for EJB annotations so that you know what
to deploy? Scannotation gives you apis that allow you to find archives in your
classpath or WAR (web application) that you want to scan, then automatically
scans them without loading each and every class within those archives

Xhotkeys provides a simple and easily configurable hotkey launcher for
the X-Window System, binding keys and mouse buttons to configurable commands.
It should work on all desktops (Gnome, KDE, Xfce, ...) available for the
GNU/Linux operating system. Configuration files can be modified manually or
using a graphical GTK+ configurator.

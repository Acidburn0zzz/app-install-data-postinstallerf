nip2 is a graphical front end to the VIPS package.
With nip2, rather than directly editing images, you build
relationships between objects in a spreadsheet-like fashion. When you
make a change somewhere, nip2 recalculates the objects affected by
that change. Since it is demand-driven this update is very fast, even
for very, very large images. nip2 is very good at creating pipelines
of image manipulation operations. It is not very good for image
editing tasks like touching up photographs. For that, a tool like the
GIMP should be used instead.

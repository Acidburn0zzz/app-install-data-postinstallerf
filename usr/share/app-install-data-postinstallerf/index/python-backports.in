Comment3='
The backports namespace is a namespace reserved for features backported from
the Python standard library to older versions of Python 2.

Packages that exist in the backports namespace in Fedora should not provide
their own backports/__init__.py, but instead require this package.
Backports to earlier versions of Python 3, if they exist, do not need this
package because of changes made in Python 3.3 in PEP 420
(http//www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/).

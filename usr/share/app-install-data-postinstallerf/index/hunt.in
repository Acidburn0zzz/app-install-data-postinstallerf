Hunt is a program for intruding into a connection, watching it and
resetting it. It was inpired by products like Juggernaut or T-sight
but has several features which can not be found in these products.

Note that hunt is operating on Ethernet and is best used for connections
which can be watched through it. However, it is possible to do something
even for hosts on another segments. The hunt doesnt distinguish between
local network connections and connections going to/from Internet. It can
handle all connections it sees.

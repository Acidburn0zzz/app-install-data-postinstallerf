NorduGrid is a collaboration aiming at development, maintenance and
support of the free Grid middleware, known as the Advanced Resource
Connector (ARC).

The Advanced Resource Connector (ARC) brings computing resources
together across institutional boundaries. This concept is commonly
referred to as a "computational grid". Historically, grids address the
organization of distributed storage of data and parallel computation,
but could be expanded to arbitrary services.

Comment3='
The package provides the \pdfmarginpar command which is similar
in spirit to \marginpar. However, it creates PDF annotations
which may be viewed with Adobe Reader in place of marginal
texts. Small icons indicate the in-text position where the
message originates, popups provide the messages themselves.
Thus bugfixes and other such communications are clearly visible
together when viewing the document, while the document itself
is not obscured.

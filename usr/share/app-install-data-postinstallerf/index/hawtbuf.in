Comment3='
This library implements a simple interface with working with
byte arrays. It is a shame that the Java SDK did not come with
a built in class that was just simply a byte[], int offset,
int length class which provided a rich interface similar to
what the String class does for char arrays. This library
fills in that void by providing a Buffer class which does provide
that rich interface.

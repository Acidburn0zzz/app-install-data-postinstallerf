The Atari++ Emulator is a Unix based emulator of the Atari eight bit
computers, namely the Atari 400 and 800, the Atari 400XL, 800XL and 130XE,
and the Atari 5200 game console. The emulator is auto-configurable and
will compile on a variety of systems (Linux, Solaris, Irix).
Atari++ 1.30 and up contain a built-in ROM emulation that tries to mimic
the AtariXL operating system closely.

Comment3='

A collection of fonts from thibault.org,
including Isabella, Essays1743, StayPuft,
and Rockets.
This font is called Rockets because its vaguely space
themed.  The A is, more or less, a 1950s SF rocket; the O is meant to
be Earth, with the Americas visible.  The other capitals are based on
curves from either A or O, to keep the theme consistent.

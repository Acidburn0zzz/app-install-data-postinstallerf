Comment3='
The rules included with the PerlCriticBangs group include
  - Commented-out code is usually noise.  It should be removed.
  - Watch for comments like "XXX", "TODO", etc.
  - Tests should have a plan.
  - Variables like $user and $user2 are insufficiently distinguished.
  - Determining the class in a constructor by using "ref($proto) || $proto".
  - Adding modifiers to a regular expression made up entirely of a variable
  created with qr() is usually not doing what you expect.
  - Vague variables like $data or $info are not descriptive enough.

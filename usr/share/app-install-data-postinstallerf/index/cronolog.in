cronolog is a simple filter program that reads log file entries from
standard input and writes each entry to the output file specified
by a filename template and the current date and time. When the
expanded filename changes, the current file is closed and a new one
opened. cronolog is intended to be used in conjunction with a Web server,
such as Apache, to split the access log into daily or monthly logs.

The Horde Framework provides a common structure and interface for Horde
applications (such as IMP, a web-based mail program). This RPM is
required for all other Horde module RPMs.

The Horde Project writes web applications in PHP and releases them under
Open Source licenses. For more information (including help with Horde
and its modules) please visit http//www.horde.org/.

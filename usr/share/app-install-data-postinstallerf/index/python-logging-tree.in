Introspection for the ``logging`` logger tree in the Standard Library.

While you can write programs that call this packages ``tree()``
function and examine the hierarchy of logger objects that it finds
inside of the Standard Library ``logging`` module, the simplest use of
this package for debugging is to call ``printout()`` to print the
loggers, filters, and handlers that your application has configured
    >>> logging.getLogger(a)
    >>> logging.getLogger(a.b).setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

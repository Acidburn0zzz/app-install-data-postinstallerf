libr12 computes types integrals that appear in Kutzelnigg?s linear R12 theories
for electronic structure. All linear R12 methods, such as MP2-R12, contain
terms in the wave function that are linear in the inter-electronic distances
r_{ij} (hence the name). Appearance of several types of two-body integrals is
due to the use of the approximate resolution of the identity to reduce three-
and four-body integrals to products of simpler integrals.

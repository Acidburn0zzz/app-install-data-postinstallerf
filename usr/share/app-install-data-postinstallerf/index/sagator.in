Comment3='
This program is an email antivirus/antispam gateway. It is an interface to
the postfix, sendmail, or any other smtpd, which runs antivirus and/or
spamchecker. Its modular architecture can use any combination of
antivirus/spamchecker according to configuration.

It has some internal checkers (string_scanner and regexp_scanner). Sagator
can parse MIME mails and decompress archives, if it is configured so.

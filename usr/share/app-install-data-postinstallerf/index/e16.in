Comment3='
Enlightenment is a window manager for the X Window System that is
designed to be powerful, extensible, configurable and pretty darned
good looking! It is one of the more graphically intense window
managers.

Enlightenment goes beyond managing windows by providing a useful and
appealing graphical shell from which to work. It is open in design and
instead of dictating a policy, allows the user to define their own
policy, down to every last detail.

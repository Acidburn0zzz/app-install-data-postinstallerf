The HTTP package supports client-side web programming in Haskell. It lets you
set up HTTP connections, transmitting requests and processing the responses
coming back, all from within the comforts of Haskell. Its dependent on the
network package to operate, but other than that, the implementation is all

A basic API for issuing single HTTP requests + receiving responses is provided.
On top of that, a session-level abstraction is also on offer (the
BrowserAction monad); it taking care of handling the management of persistent
connections, proxies, state (cookies) and authentication credentials required

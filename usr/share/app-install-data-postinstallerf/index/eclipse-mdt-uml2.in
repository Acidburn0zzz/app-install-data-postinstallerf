Comment3='
UML2 is an EMF-based implementation of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) 2.x
OMG meta-model for the Eclipse platform. The objectives of the UML2 component
are to provide a usable implementation of the UML meta-model to support the
development of modeling tools, a common XMI schema to facilitate interchange
of semantic models, test cases as a means of validating the specification and
validation rules as a means of defining and enforcing levels of compliance.

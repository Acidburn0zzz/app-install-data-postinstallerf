Comment3='
This library is intended to provide a basic interface to the most
common file and filename operations.  It provides several different
filename functions reduce, make_absolute, make_relative...  It also
enables you to manipulate real files cp, mv, rm, touch...

It is separated into two modules SysUtil and SysPath.  The first one
manipulates real files, the second one is made for manipulating
abstract filenames.

The views module provides a flexible method for Drupal site designers
to control how lists of content (nodes) are presented. Traditionally,
Drupal has hard-coded most of this, particularly in how taxonomy and
tracker lists are formatted.

This tool is essentially a smart query builder that, given enough
information, can build the proper query, execute it, and display the
results. It has four modes, plus a special mode, and provides an
impressive amount of functionality from these modes.

The package typesets a character inside a box, showing where
reference point is, and displaying width, height, and depth
information of the character. The output is like that on page
63 of "The TeXBook" or page 101 of "The METAFONTbook". The
package itself is motivated by Knuths macros in the file
manmac.tex. Users should note that using a small size for the
character inside the box does not make any sense use a large
size.

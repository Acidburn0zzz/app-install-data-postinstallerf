Comment3='
This class is a container class for numbers with a number of associated
symmetric and asymmetric errors. It overloads practically all common
arithmetic operations and trigonometric functions to propagate the errors.
It can do proper scientific rounding.

You can use MathBigFloat objects as the internal representation of numbers
in order to support arbitrary precision calculations.
Errors are propagated using Gaussian error propagation.

gdome2 is a fast, light and complete DOM level 2 implementation based
on libxml2. Although it has been written for the GNOME project, it can
be used stand-alone.  A DOM implementation (also called a host
implementation) is what makes a parsed XML or HTML document available
for processing via the DOM interface.  gdome2 currently supports the
"Core", "XML", "Events" and "MutationEvents" modules from the DOM 2
Recommendation (see http//www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/ and
http//www.w3.org/TR/DOM-L evel-2-Events/), and is supposed to become
a full implementation of all the DOM Level 2 standard.  Now gdome2
also partially supports the XPath module from the DOM level 3 drafts.

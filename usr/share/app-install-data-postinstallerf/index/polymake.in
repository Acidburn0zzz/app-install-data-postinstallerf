Polymake is a tool to study the combinatorics and the geometry of convex
polytopes and polyhedra.  It is also capable of dealing with simplicial
complexes, matroids, polyhedral fans, graphs, tropical objects, and so
forth.

Polymake can use various computational packages if they are installed.
Those available from Fedora are 4ti2, azove, gfan, latte-integrale,
normaliz, ocaml-tplib-tools, qhull, Singular, TOPCOM, and vinci.
Polymake can interface with various visualization packages if they are

Comment3='
PDL ("Perl Data Language") gives standard Perl the ability to
compactly store and speedily manipulate the large N-dimensional data
arrays which are the bread and butter of scientific computing.  PDL
turns perl into a free, array-oriented, numerical language similar to
such commercial packages as IDL and MatLab.

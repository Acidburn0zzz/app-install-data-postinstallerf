Comment3='
ClassXSAccessor implements fast read, write and read/write accessors in
XS. Additionally, it can provide predicates such as has_foo() for testing
whether the attribute foo is defined in the object. It only works with
objects that are implemented as ordinary hashes. ClassXSAccessorArray
implements the same interface for objects that use arrays for their
internal representation.

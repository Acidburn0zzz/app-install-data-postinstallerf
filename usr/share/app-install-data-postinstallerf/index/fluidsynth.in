FluidSynth is a real-time software synthesizer based on the SoundFont 2
specifications. It is a "software synthesizer". FluidSynth can read MIDI events
from the MIDI input device and render them to the audio device. It features
real-time effect modulation using SoundFont 2.01 modulators, and a built-in
command line shell. It can also play MIDI files (note FluidSynth was previously
called IIWU Synth).

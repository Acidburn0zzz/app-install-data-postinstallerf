PolyBoRi is a special purpose computer algebra system for computations
in Boolean Rings.  The core is a C++ library, which provides high-level
data types for Boolean polynomials and related structures.  As a unique
approach, binary decision diagrams are used as internal storage type for
polynomial structures.  On top of this, we provide a Python interface
for parsing of complex polynomial systems, as well as for sophisticated
and extendable strategies for Gr?bner base computation.

Comment3='
Weld is the reference implementation (RI) for JSR-299 Java Contexts and
Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform (CDI). CDI is the Java standard
for dependency injection and contextual lifecycle management, and integrates
cleanly with the Java EE platform. Any Java EE 6-compliant application server
provides support for JSR-299 (even the web profile).

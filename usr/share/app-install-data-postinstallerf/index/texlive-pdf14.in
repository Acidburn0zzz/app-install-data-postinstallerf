Comment3='
Starting with TeX Live 2010, the various formats that directly
generate PDF will default to generating PDF 1.5. This is
generally a good thing, but it can lead to compatibility issues
with some older PDF viewers. This package changes the version
of PDF generated with formats (based on pdfTeX or LuaTeX in PDF
mode), back to 1.4 for documents that need to achieve maximal
compatibility with old viewers.

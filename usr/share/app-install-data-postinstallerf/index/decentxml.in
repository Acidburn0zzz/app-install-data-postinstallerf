Comment3='
XML parser optimized for round-tripping and code reuse with main
features being
 * Allows 100% round-tripping, even for weird whitespace between
   attributes in the start tag or in the end tag
 * Suitable for building editors and filters which want/need to
   preserve the original file layout as much as possible
 * Error messages have line and column information
 * Easy to reuse individual components
 * XML 1.1 compatible

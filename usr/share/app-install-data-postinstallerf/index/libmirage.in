This is libMirage library, a CD-ROM image access library, and part of the
userspace-cdemu suite, a free, GPL CD/DVD-ROM device emulator for linux. It is
written in C and based on GLib.

The aim of libMirage is to provide uniform access to the data stored in
different image formats, by creating a representation of disc stored in image
file, which is based on GObjects.

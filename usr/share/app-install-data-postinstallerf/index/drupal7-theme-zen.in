Zen is a powerful, yet simple, HTML5 starting theme with a responsive,
mobile-first grid design. If you are building your own standards-compliant
theme, you will find it much easier to start with Zen than to start with
Garland or Stark. This theme has fantastic online documentation
(http//drupal.org/node/193318) and tons of helpful code comments
in its PHP, HTML, CSS and Sass.

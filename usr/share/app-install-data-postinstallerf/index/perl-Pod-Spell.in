Comment3='
PodSpell is a Pod formatter whose output is good for spell-checking.
PodSpell rather like PodText, except that it doesnt put much
effort into actual formatting, and it suppresses things that look like
Perl symbols or Perl jargon (so that your spell-checking program wont
complain about mystery words like "$thing" or "FooBar" or "hashref").

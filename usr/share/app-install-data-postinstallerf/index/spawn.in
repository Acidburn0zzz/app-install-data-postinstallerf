spawn is a simple parallel execution utility written to appeal to the Unix
mindset. spawn reads shell command lines from stdin, one per line, and then
executes them as maximum of N child processes in parallel, and waits for
all of the children to exit.
If a child process fails with a non-zero exit code, no new children are
spawned. Then spawn waits for all existing children to exit and returns
the failed exit code.

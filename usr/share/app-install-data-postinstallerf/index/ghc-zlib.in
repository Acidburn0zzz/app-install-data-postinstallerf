Comment='<span size="xx-large">Compression and decompression in the gzip and zlib formats</span>'
Comment3='
This package provides a pure interface for compressing and decompressing
streams of data represented as lazy ByteStrings. It uses the zlib C library
so it has high performance. It supports the zlib, gzip and raw
compression formats.

It provides a convenient high level API suitable for most tasks and for the few
cases where more control is needed it provides access to the full zlib feature
set.

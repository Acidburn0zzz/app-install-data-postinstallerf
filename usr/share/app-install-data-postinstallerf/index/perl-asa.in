Perl 5 doesnt natively support Java-style interfaces, and it doesnt
support Perl 6 style roles either.

You can get both of these things in half a dozen different ways via various
CPAN modules, but they usually require that you buy into "their way" of
implementing your code.
This package overrides the isa() method, allowing your class to claim its a
class its not (that is, isnt in @ISA).

Raydium is a game engine. It provides a set of functions which allow quick and
flexible games creation. There are a lot of other 3D/game engines (and some
are very complete, such as Ogre, Crystal Space, etc). Raydium does not try to
be as complex as these engines, but on the contrary is aiming at quick and
simple development.

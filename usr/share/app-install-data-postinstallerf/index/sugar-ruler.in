Ruler is a simple collection of measurement tools that are displayed
on the screen. Since the OLPC XO computer has a 200 DPI display, the
rulers are quite accurate. One other hardware, where the display
resolution is not known, their is a spinner to let the user set the DPI.
Ruler saves this value to the Journal, so it need not be set on
subsequent uses of the Activity.

Texapi provides utility macros to write format-independent (and
-aware) packages. It is similar in spirit to the etoolbox,
except that it isnt tied to LaTeX. Tools include engine and
format detection, expansion control, command definition and
manipulation, various testing macros, string operations, and
highly customizable while and for loops. The package requires
e-TeX (and, should you want to compile its documentation, the
pitex package is also needed).

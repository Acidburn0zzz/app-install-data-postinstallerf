Comment3='
This module provides a number of list utility functions, all of which take
an initial code block to control their behaviour. They are variations on
similar core perl or ListUtil functions of similar names, but which use
the block to control their behaviour. For example, the core Perl function
sort takes a list of values and returns them, sorted into order by their
string value. The sort_by function sorts them according to the string value
returned by the extra function, when given each value.

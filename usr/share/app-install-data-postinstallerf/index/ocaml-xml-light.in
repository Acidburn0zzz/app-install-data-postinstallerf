Comment3='
Xml-Light is a minimal XML parser & printer for OCaml. It provides
functions to parse an XML document into an OCaml data structure, work
with it, and print it back to an XML document. It support also DTD
parsing and checking, and is entirely written in OCaml, hence it does
not require additional C library.

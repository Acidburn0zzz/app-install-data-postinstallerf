POEComponentIRC is a POE component (whod have guessed?) which acts as an
easily controllable IRC client for your other POE components and sessions. You
create an IRC component and tell it what events your session cares about and
where to connect to, and it sends back interesting IRC events when they
happen. You make the client do things by sending it events. Thats all there
is to it. Cool, no?

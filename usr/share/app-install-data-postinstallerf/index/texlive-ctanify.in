Given a list of filenames, ctanify creates a tarball (a .tar.gz
file) with the files laid out in CTANs preferred structure.
The tarball additionally contains a ZIP (.zip) file with copies
of all files laid out in the standard TeX Directory Structure
(TDS), which may be used by those intending to install the
package, or by those who need to incorporate it in a
distribution. (The TDS ZIP file will be installed in the CTAN
install/ tree.)

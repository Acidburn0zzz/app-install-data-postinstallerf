Comment3='
Allows LaTeX constructions (equations, picture environments,
etc.) to be precisely superimposed over Encapsulated PostScript
figures, using your own favorite drawing tool to create an EPS
figure and placing simple text tags where each replacement is
to be placed, with PSfrag automatically removing these tags
from the figure and replacing them with a user specified LaTeX
construction, properly aligned, scaled, and/or rotated.

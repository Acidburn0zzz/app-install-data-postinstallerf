Pidgin allows you to talk to anyone using a variety of messaging
protocols including AIM, MSN, Yahoo!, Jabber, Bonjour, Gadu-Gadu,
ICQ, IRC, Novell Groupwise, QQ, Lotus Sametime, SILC, Simple and
Zephyr.  These protocols are implemented using a modular, easy to
use design.  To use a protocol, just add an account using the
account editor.

Pidgin supports many common features of other clients, as well as many
unique features, such as perl scripting, TCL scripting and C plugins.

Log4cxx is a popular logging package written in C++. One of its distinctive
features is the notion of inheritance in loggers. Using a logger hierarchy it
is possible to control which log statements are output at arbitrary
granularity. This helps reduce the volume of logged output and minimize the
cost of logging.

Comment3='
PBKDF2 is a secure password hashing algorithm that uses the techniques of
"key strengthening" to make the complexity of a brute-force attack
arbitrarily high. PBKDF2 uses any other cryptographic hash or cipher (by
convention, usually HMAC-SHA1, but CryptPBKDF2 is fully pluggable), and
allows for an arbitrary number of iterations of the hashing function, and a
nearly unlimited output hash size (up to 2**32 - 1 times the size of the
output of the back-end hash). The hash is salted, as any password hash
should be, and the salt may also be of arbitrary size.

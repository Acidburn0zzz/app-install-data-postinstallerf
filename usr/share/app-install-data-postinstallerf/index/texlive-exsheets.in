The package provides the means to create exercises or questions
and their corresponding solutions. The questions may be divided
into classes and/or topics and may be printed selectively.
Meta-data to questions can be added and recovered. The
solutions may be printed where they are, or collected and
printed at a later point in the document all together, section-
wise or selectively by ID. The package provides the means to
selectively include questions from an external file, and to
control the style of headings of both questions and solutions.

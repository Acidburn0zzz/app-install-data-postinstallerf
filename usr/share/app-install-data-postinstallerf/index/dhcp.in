DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a protocol which allows
individual devices on an IP network to get their own network
configuration information (IP address, subnetmask, broadcast address,
etc.) from a DHCP server. The overall purpose of DHCP is to make it
easier to administer a large network.

To use DHCP on your network, install a DHCP service (or relay agent),
and on clients run a DHCP client daemon.  The dhcp package provides
the ISC DHCP service and relay agent.

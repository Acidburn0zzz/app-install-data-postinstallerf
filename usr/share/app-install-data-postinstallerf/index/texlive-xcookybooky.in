The package enables the user to typeset recipes, which could be
greater than one page. Above the recipe text two (optional)
pictures can be displayed. Other features are recipe name,
energy content, portions, preparation and baking time, baking
temperatures, recipe source and of course preparation steps and
required ingredients. At the bottom you may insert an optional
hint. The package depends on the Emerald fonts.

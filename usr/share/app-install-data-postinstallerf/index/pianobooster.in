A MIDI file player/game that displays the musical notes AND teaches you how
to play the piano.

PianoBooster is a fun way of playing along with a musical accompaniment and
at the same time learning the basics of reading musical notation.
The difference between playing along to a CD or a standard MIDI file
is that PianoBooster listens and reacts to what you are playing on a
MIDI keyboard.

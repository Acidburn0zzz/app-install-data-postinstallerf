The X2Go Server printing package provides client-side printing support for
X2Go.

This package has to be installed on X2Go servers that shall be able to pass
X2Go print jobs on to the X2Go client.
This package co-operates with the cups-x2go CUPS backend. If CUPS server and
X2Go server are hosted on different machines, then make sure you install
this package on the X2Go server(s) (and the cups-x2go package on the CUPS
server).

Streamtuner lists radio directory services like Shoutcast, Xiph, Live365,
MyOggRadio, Jamendo. It allows listening via any audio player and recording of
streams via streamripper.
This is streamtuner2 which mimics the older streamtuner 0.99.99 application
in look and feel. But its an independent rewrite and runs on Python;
is therefore easier to extend.

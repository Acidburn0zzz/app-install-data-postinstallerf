biosdevname in its simplest form takes a kernel device name as an
argument, and returns the BIOS-given name it "should" be.  This is necessary
on systems where the BIOS name for a given device (e.g. the label on
the chassis is "Gb1") doesnt map directly and obviously to the kernel
name (e.g. eth0).

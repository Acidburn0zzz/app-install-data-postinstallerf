Hepnames provides a pair of LaTeX packages, heppennames and
hepnicenames, providing a large set of pre-defined high energy
physics particle names built with the hepparticles package. The
packages are based on pennames.sty by Michel Goosens and Eric
van Herwijnen. Heppennames re-implements the particle names in
pennames.sty, with some additions and alterations and greater
flexibility and robustness due to the hepparticles structures,
which were written for this purpose. Hepnicenames provides the
main non-resonant particle names from heppennames with more
"friendly" names.

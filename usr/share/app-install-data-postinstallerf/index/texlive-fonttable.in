This is a package version of nfssfont.tex (part of the LaTeX
distribution); it enables you to print a table of the
characters of a font and/or some text (for demonstration or
testing purposes), from within a document. (Packages such as
testfont and nfssfont.tex provide these facilities, but they
run as interactive programs the user is expected to type
details of what is needed.) Note that the package mftinc also
has a \fonttable function; the documentation explains how avoid
a clash with that package.

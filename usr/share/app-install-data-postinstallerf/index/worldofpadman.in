Comment3='
World of Padman (WoP) is a first-person shooter computer game available in
both English and German. The idea is based on the Padman comic strip for the
magazine PlayStation Games created by the professional cartoon artist Andreas
ENTE Endres, who is also the man who made many of the maps included with the
game in 1998. Most of the maps in the game are lilliput style.

World of Padman uses the GPL licensed ioquake3 engine, however the Wop data-
files are not freely redistributable. This package will install a World of
Padman menu entry, which will automatically download the necessary datafiles
(900 MB!) the first time you start World of Padman.

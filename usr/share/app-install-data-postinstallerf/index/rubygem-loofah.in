Loofah is a general library for manipulating and transforming HTML/XML
documents and fragments. Its built on top of Nokogiri and libxml2, so
its fast and has a nice API.
Loofah excels at HTML sanitization (XSS prevention). It includes some
nice HTML sanitizers, which are based on HTML5libs whitelist, so it
most likely wont make your codes less secure.

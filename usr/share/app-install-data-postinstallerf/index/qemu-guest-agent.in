QEMU is a generic and open source processor emulator which achieves a good
emulation speed by using dynamic translation.

This package provides an agent to run inside guests, which communicates
with the host over a virtio-serial channel named "org.qemu.guest_agent.0"
This package does not need to be installed on the host OS.

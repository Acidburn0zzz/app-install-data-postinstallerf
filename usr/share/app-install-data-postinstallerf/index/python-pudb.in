PuDB is a full-screen, console-based visual debugger for Python.

Its goal is to provide all the niceties of modern GUI-based debuggers in a more
lightweight and keyboard-friendly package. PuDB allows you to debug code right
(but nowadays ancient) DOS-based Turbo Pascal or C tools, PuDBs UI might look
familiar.

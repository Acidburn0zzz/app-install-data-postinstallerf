MyPasswordSafe is a straight-forward, easy-to-use password manager that
maintains compatibility with Password Safe files. MyPasswordSafe has the
following features

* Safes are encrypted when they are stored to disk.
* Passwords never have to be seen, because they are copied to the clipboard
* Random passwords can be generated.
* Window size, position, and column widths are remembered.
* Passwords remain encrypted until they need to be decrypted at the dialog
  and file levels.

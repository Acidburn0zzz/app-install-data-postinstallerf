DenyHosts is a Python script that analyzes the sshd server log
messages to determine which hosts are attempting to hack into your
system. It also determines what user accounts are being targeted. It
keeps track of the frequency of attempts from each host and, upon
discovering a repeated attack host, updates the /etc/hosts.deny file
to prevent future break-in attempts from that host.  Email reports can
be sent to a system admin.

Audacious is an advanced audio player. It is free, lightweight, currently
based on GTK+ 3, runs on Linux and many other *nix platforms and is
focused on audio quality and supporting a wide range of audio codecs.
It still features an alternative skinned user interface (based on
Winamp 2.x skins). Historically, it started as a fork of Beep Media
Player (BMP), which itself forked from XMMS.

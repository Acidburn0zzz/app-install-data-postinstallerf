Comment3='
Qjackctl is a simple application to control the JACK sound server daemon,
specific for the Linux Audio Desktop infrastructure. It provides a simple GUI
dialog for setting several JACK daemon parameters, which are properly saved
between sessions, and a way to control the status of the audio server daemon.
With time, this primordial interface has become richer by including a enhanced
patchbay and connection control features.

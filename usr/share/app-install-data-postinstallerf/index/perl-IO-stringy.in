This toolkit primarily provides modules for performing both traditional
and object-oriented I/O) on things *other* than normal filehandles; in
particular, IOScalar, IOScalarArray, and IOLines.

In the more-traditional IOHandle front, we have IOAtomicFile, which
may be used to painlessly create files that are updated atomically.
And in the "this-may-prove-useful" corner, we have IOWrap, whose
exported wraphandle() function will clothe anything thats not a blessed
object in an IOHandle-like wrapper... so you can just use OO syntax

Foomatic is a comprehensive, spooler-independent database of printers,
printer drivers, and driver descriptions. This package contains
utilities to generate driver description files and printer queues for
CUPS, LPD, LPRng, and PDQ using the database (packaged separately).
There is also the possibility to read the PJL options out of PJL-capable
laser printers and take them into account at the driver description
file generation.

There are spooler-independent command line interfaces to manipulate
queues (foomatic-configure) and to print files/manipulate jobs

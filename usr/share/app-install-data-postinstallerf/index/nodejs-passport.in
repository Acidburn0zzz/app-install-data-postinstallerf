Passport is an authentication framework for Connect and Express, which
is extensible through "plugins" known as strategies.

Passport is designed to be a general-purpose, yet simple, modular, and
unobtrusive, authentication framework. Passports sole purpose is to
authenticate requests. In being modular, it doesnt force any particular
authentication strategy on your application. In being unobtrusive, it
doesnt mount routes in your application. The API is simple you give
Passport a request to authenticate, and Passport provides hooks for
controlling what occurs when authentication succeeds or fails.

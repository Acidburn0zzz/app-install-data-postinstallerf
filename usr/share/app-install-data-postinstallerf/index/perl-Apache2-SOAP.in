This Apache Perl module provides the ability to add support for SOAP
(Simple Object Access Protocol) protocol with easy configuration
(either in .conf or in .htaccess file). This functionality should
give you lightweight option for hosting SOAP services and greatly
simplify configuration aspects. This module inherites functionality
from SOAPTransportHTTP2Apache component of SOAPLite module.

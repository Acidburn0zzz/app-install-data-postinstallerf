This package enables you to do generic message logging throughout programs and
projects. Every message will be logged with stack traces, time stamps and so
on.  You can use built-in handlers immediately, or after the fact when you
inspect the error stack. It is highly configurable and lets you even provide
your own handlers for dealing with messages.

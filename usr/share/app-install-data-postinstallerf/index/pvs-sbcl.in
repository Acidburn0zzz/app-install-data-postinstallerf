PVS is a verification system that is, a specification language
integrated with support tools and a theorem prover.  It is intended to
capture the state-of-the-art in mechanized formal methods and to be
sufficiently rugged that it can be used for significant applications.

This build of PVS must be invoked as "pvs-sbcl", both to distinguish it
from builds with other Common Lisp engines, and to distinguish it from
/usr/sbin/pvs in the lvm2 package.

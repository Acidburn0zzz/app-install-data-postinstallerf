The Bash Debugger Project is a source-code debugger for bash,
which follows the gdb command syntax.
The purpose of the BASH debugger is to check
what is going on ?inside? a bash script, while it executes
    * Start a script, specifying conditions that might affect its behavior.
    * Stop a script at certain conditions (break points).
    * Examine the state of a script.
    * Experiment, by changing variable values on the fly.
The 4.0 series is a complete rewrite of the previous series.

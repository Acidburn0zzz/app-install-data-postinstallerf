This module tries to make install path resolution as easy as possible.

When you want to install a module, it needs to figure out where to install
things. The nutshell version of how this works is that default installation
locations are determined from ExtUtilsConfig, and they may be individually
overridden by using the install_path attribute. An install_base attribute lets
you specify an alternative installation root like /home/foo and prefix does
something similar in a rather different (and more complicated) way. destdir
lets you specify a temporary installation directory like /tmp/install in case
you want to create bundled-up installable packages.

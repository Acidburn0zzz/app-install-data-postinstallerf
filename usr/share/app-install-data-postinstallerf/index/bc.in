The bc package includes bc and dc. Bc is an arbitrary precision
numeric processing arithmetic language. Dc is an interactive
arbitrary precision stack based calculator, which can be used as a
text mode calculator.

Install the bc package if you need its number handling capabilities or
if you would like to use its text mode calculator.

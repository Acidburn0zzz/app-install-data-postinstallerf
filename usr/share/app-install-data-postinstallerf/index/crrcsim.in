Crrcsim is a model-airplane flight simulation program.
Using it, you can learn how to fly model aircraft, test new aircraft designs,
and improve your skills by practicing on your computer.

The flight model is very realistic.
The flight model parameters are calculated based on a 3D representation
of the aircraft. Stalls are properly modeled as well.
Model control is possible with your own RC transmitter, or any input device
such as joystick, mouse, keyboard.

Comment3='
Zend\Http is a primary foundational component of Zend Framework. Since much
of what PHP does is web-based, specifically HTTP, it makes sense to have a
performant, extensible, concise and consistent API to do all things HTTP.
In nutshell, there are several parts of Zend\Http

* Context-less Request and Response classes that expose a fluent API for
  introspecting several aspects of HTTP messages
  ** Request line information and response status information
  ** Parameters, such as those found in POST and GET
  ** Message Body

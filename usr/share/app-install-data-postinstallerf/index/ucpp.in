A C preprocessor is a part of a C compiler responsible for macro replacement,
conditional compilation and inclusion of header files. It is often found as
a stand-alone program on Unix systems.

ucpp is such a preprocessor; it is designed to be quick and light, but anyway
fully compliant to the ISO standard 98991999, also known as C99. ucpp can be
compiled as a stand-alone program, or linked to some other code; in the latter
case, ucpp will output tokens, one at a time, on demand, as an integrated lexer.

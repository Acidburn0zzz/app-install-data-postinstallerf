This widget provides a dynamic image that looks just like
a Mac OS 9 progress bar.  Packed around it are four
Frames, north, south, east and west, within which you can
stuff additional widgets. For example, see how TkCopyMac
uses several Labels and a CollapsableFrame widget to create
a reasonable facsimile of a Macintosh copy dialog.

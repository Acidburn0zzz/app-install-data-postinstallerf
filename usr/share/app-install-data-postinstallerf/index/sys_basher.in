sys_basher is a multithreaded system exerciser. It tests the CPU, RAM and Disks
under conditions of maximum stress by running CPU, Memory and Disk tests on all
Cores simultaneously. In addition to reliablity testing, sys_basher measures
low level functions including memory bandwidth, disk IO bandwidth and integer
and floating point operations using unrolled loops.

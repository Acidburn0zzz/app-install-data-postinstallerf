Comment3='
The package extends and improves the robustness of the pgfkeys
package. In particular, it can deal with active comma, equality
sign, and slash in key parsing. The difficulty with active
characters has long been a problem with the pgfkeys package.
The package also introduces handlers beyond those that pgfkeys
can offer.

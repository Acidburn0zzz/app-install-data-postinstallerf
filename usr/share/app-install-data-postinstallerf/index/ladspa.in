There is a large number of synthesis packages in use or development on
the Linux platform at this time. The Linux Audio Developers Simple
Plugin API (LADSPA) attempts to give programmers the ability to write
simple `plugin audio processors in C/C++ and link them dynamically
against a range of host applications.

This package contains the example plug-ins and tools from the LADSPA SDK.

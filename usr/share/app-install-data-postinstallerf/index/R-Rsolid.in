Rsolid is an R package for normalizing fluorescent intensity data from
ABI/SOLiD second generation sequencing platform. It has been observed
that the color-calls provided by factory software contain technical
artifacts, where the proportions of colors called are extremely
variable across sequencing cycles. Under the random DNA fragmentation
assumption, these proportions should be equal across sequencing cycles
and proportional to the dinucleotide frequencies of the sample.
Rsolid implements a version of the quantile normalization algorithm

Comment3='
A lightweight mind-mapping activity based on an Open Source project called
Labyrinth. It allows creating mind maps from a mixture of text, freehand
drawings, and images from your Journal. There is an infinite sized canvas
for your map that can be panned and zoomed while you work. Maps can be
"Kept to PDF" for uploading to web sites, sharing, and printing by others
who may not be using Sugar.

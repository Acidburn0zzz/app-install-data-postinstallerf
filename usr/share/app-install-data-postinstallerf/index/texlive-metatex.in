METATeX is a set of plain TeX and MetaFont macros that you can
use to define both the text and the figures in a single source
file. Because METATeX sets up two way communication, from TeX
to MetaFont and back from MetaFont to TeX, drawing dimensions
can be controlled by TeX and labels can be located by MetaFont.
Only standard features of TeX and MetaFont are used, but two
runs of TeX and one of MetaFont are needed.

SYMPHONY is an open-source solver for mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs)
written in C. It can be used in three different main modes

  * As a callable library through either the native C interface or through
    the Osi.
  * As an interactive solver using a command-line interface.
  * As a framework to build customized solvers for specific problem classes.
SYMPHONY can be executed in either parallel (distributed or shared memory)
or sequential modes and has a number of advanced features that make it unique,

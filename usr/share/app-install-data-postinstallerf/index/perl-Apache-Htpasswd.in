This module comes with a set of methods to use with htaccess password files.
These files (and htaccess) are used to do Basic Authentication on a web server.
The passwords file is a flat-file with login name and their associated
encrypted password. You can use this for non-Apache files if you wish, but it
was written specifically for .htaccess style files.

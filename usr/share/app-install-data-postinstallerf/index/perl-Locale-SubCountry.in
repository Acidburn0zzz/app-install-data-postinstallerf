This module allows you to convert the full name for a countries administrative
region to the code commonly used for postal addressing. The reverse look-up
can also be done. Sub country codes are defined in "ISO 3166-22007, Codes for
the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions".

Sub countries are termed as states in the US and Australia, provinces in
Canada and counties in the UK and Ireland.

Comment3='

Artwiz is a family of very small futuristic fonts, with varying styles of
typefaces designed at a single pixel size. The minimal nature of the
fonts makes them popular with users of lightweight window managers. These
fonts have been updated by Alec Zapka to be compatible with modern
software and support an extended character set.
This package contains the Snap font in three encodings, English, German,
and Swedish.

This libary can serve as an advanced lexer for (GNU) makefiles. It parses
makefiles as "documents" and the parsing is lossless. The results are data
structures similar to DOM trees. The DOM trees hold every single bit of the
information in the original input files, including white spaces, blank
lines and makefile comments. That means its possible to reproduce the
original makefiles from the DOM trees. In addition, each node of the DOM
trees is modifiable and so is the whole tree, just like the PPI module used
for Perl source parsing and the HTMLTreeBuilder module used for parsing
HTML source.

igraph wants to be an efficient platform for
1) complex network analysis and
2) developing and implementing graph algorithms.
It provides flexible and efficient data structures for graphs and related
tasks. It also provides implementation to many classic and new graph
algorithms like maximum flows, graph isomorphism, scale-free
networks, community structure finding, etc.

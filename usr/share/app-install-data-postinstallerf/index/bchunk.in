Comment3='
The bchunk package contains a UNIX/C rewrite of the BinChunker program.
BinChunker converts a CD image in a .bin/.cue format (sometimes .raw/.cue)
into a set of .iso and .cdr tracks.  The .bin/.cue format is used by some
non-UNIX CD-writing software, but is not supported on most other
CD-writing programs.

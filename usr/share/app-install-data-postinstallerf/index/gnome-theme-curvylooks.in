Comment3='
CurvyLooks, inspired by and based heavily on the work of Billy Cantrells
Clearlooks_Cairo-Curve and GNOME 3s Adwaita themes, is a set of simple themes
for GTK+ 2 and 3 which use modern features of the Clearlooks engine and a
Bluecurve-like color scheme to provide a rich and aesthetically-pleasing
desktop experience, especially for prolonged periods of usage.

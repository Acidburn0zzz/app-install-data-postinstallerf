TestExpect is a module for automated driving and testing of
terminal-based programs. It is handy for testing interactive programs
which have a prompt, and is based on the same concepts as the Tcl Expect
tool. As in ExpectSimple, the Expect object is made available for
tweaking.

TestExpect is intended for use in a test script.

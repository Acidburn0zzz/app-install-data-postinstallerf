HEALPix is an acronym for Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization
of a sphere. As suggested in the name, this pixelization produces a
subdivision of a spherical surface in which each pixel covers the same
surface area as every other pixel.

This package contains the library for tools that use HEALPix C bindings.

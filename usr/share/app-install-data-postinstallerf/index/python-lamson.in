Lamson is a pure Python SMTP server designed to create robust and complex mail
applications in the style of modern web frameworks such as Django. Unlike
traditional SMTP servers like Postfix or Sendmail, Lamson has all the features
of a web application stack (ORM, templates, routing, handlers, state machines,
Python) without needing to configure alias files, run new aliases, or juggle
tons of tiny fragile processes. Lamson also plays well with other web
frameworks and Python libraries.

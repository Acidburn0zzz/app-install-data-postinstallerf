mkrf is a library for generating Rakefiles to build Ruby
extension modules written in C. It is intended as a replacement for
mkmf. The major difference between the two is that mkrf
builds you a Rakefile instead of a Makefile.

This proposed replacement to mkmf generates Rakefiles to build C Extensions.

"An alloy is a homogeneous mixture of two or more elements"
(http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy).

TemplateAlloy represents the mixing of features and capabilities from all of
the major mini-language based template systems (support for non-mini-language
based systems will happen eventually).  With TemplateAlloy you can use your
favorite template interface and syntax and get features from each of the other
major template systems.  And TemplateAlloy is fast - whether youre using
mod_perl, CGI, or running from the command line.  There is even
TemplateAlloyXS for getting a little more speed when that is necessary.

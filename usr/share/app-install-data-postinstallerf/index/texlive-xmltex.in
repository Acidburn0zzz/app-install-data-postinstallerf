Comment3='
This package provides an implementation of a parser for
documents matching the XML 1.0 and XML Namespace
Recommendations. In addition to parsing commands are provided
to attatch TeX typesetting instructions to the various markup
elemenets as they are encounted. Sample files for typesetting a
subset of TEI, MathML, are included. Element and Attribute
names, as well as character data, may use any characters
allowed in XML, using UTF-8 or a suitable 8-bit encoding.

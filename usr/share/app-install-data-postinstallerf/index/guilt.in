Guilt allows one to use quilt functionality on top of a Git repository.
Changes are maintained as patches which are committed into Git.  Commits can
be removed or reordered, and the underlying patch can be refreshed based on
changes made in the working directory. The patch directory can also be
placed under revision control, so you can have a separate history of changes
made to your patches.

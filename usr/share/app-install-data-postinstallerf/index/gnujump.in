GNUjump is a clone of the simple yet addictive game Xjump, adding new features
like multiplaying, unlimited FPS, smooth floor falling, themable graphics,
sounds,replays, etc.

The goal in this game is to jump to the next floor trying not to fall down. As
you go upper in the Falling Tower the floors will fall faster. Try to survive
longer get upper than anyone. It might seem too simple but once youve tried
youll realize how addictive this is.

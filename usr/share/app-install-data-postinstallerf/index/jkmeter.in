jkmeter is a horizontal or vertical bar-graph level
meter based on the ideas of mastering guru Bob Katz.
See <http//www.digido.com/bob-katz/index.php> and
follow the links on level practices.

This is the type of meter you want for live recording,
mixing and mastering. It probably makes no sense to
use it on all tracks of a DAW, where keeping digital
level within limits is the main purpose of metering.

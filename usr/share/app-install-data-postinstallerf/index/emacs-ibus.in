ibus.el is a IBus client for GNU Emacs. This program allows users
on-the-spot style input with IBus. The input statuses are individually
kept for each buffer, and prefix-keys such as C-x and C-c can be used
even if IBus is active. So you can input various languages fast and
comfortably by using it.

Never before has collecting mushrooms been this mildly entertaining. At least
not in outer space. Its more of a lifestyle than a game, really. Now with
graphics and sound, too!

Seriously though, we like to think the game as a
space-flying-mushroom-picking-simulator. Well no, "Those Funny Funguloids!" is
actually a nice little piece of entertainment. You collect mushrooms, bring them
back to your home base and profit! Thats the basic idea in a nutshell. It has
smooth, appealing 3d graphics and nice atmospheric sound effects. Go ahead and
try it out - it has sounds too!

DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded Checkpointing) is a tool to transparently
checkpointing the state of an arbitrary group of programs including
multi-threaded and distributed computations.  It operates directly on the user
binary executable, with no Linux kernel modules or other kernel mods.

Among the applications supported by DMTCP are OpenMPI, MATLAB, Python, Perl,
and many programming languages and shell scripting languages.  DMTCP also
supports GNU screen sessions, including vim/cscope and emacs. With the use of
TightVNC, it can also checkpoint and restart X-Windows applications, as long as
they do not use extensions (e.g. no OpenGL, no video).

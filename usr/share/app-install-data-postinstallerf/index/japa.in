japa (JACK and ALSA Perceptual Analyser), is a perceptual or
psychoacoustic audio spectrum analyser.

In contrast to JAAA, this is more an acoustical or musical tool than a
purely technical one. Possible uses include spectrum monitoring while
mixing or mastering, evaluation of ambient noise, and (using pink
noise), equalisation of PA systems.

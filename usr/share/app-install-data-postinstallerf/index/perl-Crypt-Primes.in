This module implements Ueli Maurers algorithm for generating large provable
primes and secure parameters for public-key cryptosystems. The generated primes
are almost uniformly distributed over the set of primes of the specified
bitsize and expected time for generation is less than the time required for
generating a pseudo-prime of the same size with Miller-Rabin tests. Detailed
description and running time analysis of the algorithm can be found in Maurers
paper, "Fast Generation of Prime Numbers and Secure Public-Key Cryptographic
Parameters" (1994).

Mozinstall is a Python package for installing Mozilla applications on
various platforms.  For example, depending on the platform, Firefox
can be distributed as a zip, tar.bz2, exe or dmg file or cloned from a
repository. Mozinstall takes the hassle out of extracting and/or
running these files and for convenience returns the full path to the
applications binary in the install directory. In the case that
mozinstall is invoked from the command line, the binary path will be
printed to standard output.

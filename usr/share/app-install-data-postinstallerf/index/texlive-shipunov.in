The bundle collects packages and classes, along with one
bibliography style and examples and scripts for converting TeX
files. Many of the files in the collection are designed to
support field biologists and/or Russian writers, while others
have wider application. The collection includes (among others)
- altverse, a simple verse typesetting package; - autolist,
which provides various list formatting facilities; - biokey,
which provides a mechanism for typesetting biological
identification lists; - biolist, which typesets species lists;
- boldline, which typesets heavier separating lines in tables;

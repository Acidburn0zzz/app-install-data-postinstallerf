This API is meant to be used in place of the API provided by image.inc. You
probably do not need to install this module unless another module are you
using requires it. It provides no new features to your Drupal site. It only
provides an API other modules can leverage. Currently GD2 and ImageMagick
support are distributed with ImageAPI.

This package provides the following Drupal modules
* imageapi
* imageapi_gd
* imageapi_imagemagick

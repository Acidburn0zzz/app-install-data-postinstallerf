GNOME MPlayer is a simple GUI for MPlayer. It is intended to be a nice tight
player and provide a simple and clean interface to MPlayer. GNOME MPlayer has
a rich API that is exposed via DBus. Using DBus you can control a single or
multiple instances of GNOME MPlayer from a single command.
This package provides a version with reduced requirements, targeted at users
who want browser plugin functionality only.

Comment3='
Many sites need to notify users when certain events have occurred and to
allow configurable options as to how those notifications are to be received.

The project aims to provide a Django app for this sort of functionality.
This includes
    * submission of notification messages by other apps
    * notification messages on signing in
    * notification messages via email (configurable by user)
    * notification messages via feed

A LaTeX2e package for drawing tangles, trees, Hopf algebra
operations and other pictures. It is based on emTeX or TPIC
\specials. Therefore, it can be used with the most popular
drivers, including emTeX drivers, dviwin, xdvi and dvips, and
(using some code from ConTeXt) it may also be used with
PDFLaTeX.

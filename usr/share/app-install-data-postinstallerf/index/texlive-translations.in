This package (once part of the exsheets package), provides a
framework for providing multilingual features to a LaTeX
package. The package has its own basic dictionaries for
English, French, German and Spanish; it aims to use translation
material for English, French, German, Italian, Spanish,
Catalan, Turkish, Croatian, Hungarian, Danish and Portuguese
from babel or polyglossia if either is in use in the document.
(Additional languages from the multilingual packages may be
possible ask the author.)

Comment3='
lpf (Local Package Factory) is designed to handle two separate
problems
 - Packages built from sources which does not allow redistribution.
 - Packages requiring user to accept EULA-like terms.

It works by downloading sources, possibly requiring a user to accept
license terms and then building and installing rpm package(s) locally.
Besides being interactive the operation is similar to akmod and dkms.

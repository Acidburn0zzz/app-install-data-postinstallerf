Comment3='
Gambatte is an accuracy-focused, open-source, cross-platform
Game Boy Color emulator written in C++. It is based on hundreds of
corner case hardware tests, as well as previous documentation and reverse
engineering efforts.

The core emulation code is contained in a separate library back-end
(libgambatte) written in platform-independent C++.

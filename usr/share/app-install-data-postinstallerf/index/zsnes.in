This is an emulator for Nintendos 16 bit console, called Super Nintendo
Entertainment System or Super Famicom. It features a pretty accurate emulation
of that systems graphic and sound capabilities.
The GUI enables the user to select games, change options, enable cheat codes
and to save the game state, even network play is possible.

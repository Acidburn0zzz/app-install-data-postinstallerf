Enblend is a tool for compositing images, given a set of images that overlap in
some irregular way, Enblend overlays them in such a way that the seam between
the images is invisible, or at least very difficult to see.  Enfuse combines
multiple images of the same subject into a single image with good exposure and
good focus.  Enblend and Enfuse do not line up the images for you, use a tool
like Hugin to do that.

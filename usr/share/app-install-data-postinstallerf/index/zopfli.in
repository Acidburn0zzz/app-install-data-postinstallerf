Zopfli is a compresssion algorithm bit-stream compatible with compression
used in gzip, Zip, PNG, HTTP requests, and others. Zopfli compresses more (~5%)
but is slower (~100x) and uses more CPU and hence best suited for applications
where data is compressed once  and sent over a network many times, for example,
static content for the web.

DiffLCS is a port of AlgorithmDiff that uses the McIlroy-Hunt longest
common subsequence (LCS) algorithm to compute intelligent differences between
two sequenced enumerable containers. The implementation is based on Mario I.
Wolczkos Smalltalk version (1.2, 1993) and Ned Konzs Perl version
(AlgorithmDiff).

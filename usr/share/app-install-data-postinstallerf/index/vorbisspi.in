VorbisSPI is a Java Service Provider Interface that adds OGG Vorbis audio
format support to Java platform. It supports Icecast streaming. It is
based on JOrbis Java libraries.

OGG Vorbis is a fully Open, non-proprietary, patent-and-royalty-free,
general-purpose compressed audio format for high quality (44.1-48.0kHz,
16+ bit, polyphonic) audio and music at fixed and variable bit rates from
16 to 128 Kbps/channel. This places Vorbis in the same class as audio
representations including MPEG-1 audio layer 3, MPEG-4 audio
(AAC and TwinVQ), and PAC.

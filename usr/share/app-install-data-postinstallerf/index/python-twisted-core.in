Comment3='
An extensible framework for Python programming, with special focus
on event-based network programming and multiprotocol integration.

It is expected that one day the project will expanded to the point
that the framework will seamlessly integrate with mail, web, DNS,
netnews, IRC, RDBMSs, desktop environments, and your toaster.
Twisted Core is used by most of the servers, clients and protocols that are
part of other Twisted projects.

"WWWMechanize", or Mech for short, helps you automate interaction
with a website.  It supports performing a sequence of page fetches
including following links and submitting forms. Each fetched page is
parsed and its links and forms are extracted. A link or a form can be
selected, form fields can be filled and the next page can be fetched.
Mech also stores a history of the URLs youve visited, which can be
queried and revisited.

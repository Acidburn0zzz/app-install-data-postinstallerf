freecode-submit is a script that supports remote submission of release
updates to Freecode via its JSON API. It is intended for use in project
release scripts. It reads the metadata from an RFC-2822-like message on
standard input, possibly with overrides by command-line switches. It
supersedes freshmeat-submit, which no longer works following the site
name change.

Comment3='
QSynth is a fluidsynth GUI front-end application written in C++ around the Qt4
toolkit using Qt Designer. Eventually it may evolve into a softsynth management
application allowing the user to control and manage a variety of command line
softsynth but for the moment it wraps the excellent FluidSynth. FluidSynth is a
command line software synthesizer based on the Soundfont specification.

This module implements draft 0.4 of John Cowans XML Catalog (formerly
known as XCatalog) see
(<https//www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/specs/cs-entity-xml-catalogs-1.0.html>)
Catalogs may be written in either SOCAT or XML syntax. XMLCatalog will
assume SOCAT syntax if the catalog is not in well-formed XML syntax.

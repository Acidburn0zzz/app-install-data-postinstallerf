XTide is a package that provides tide and current
predictions in a wide variety of formats.  Graphs, text listings, and
calendars can be generated, or a tide clock can be provided on your
desktop.

XTide can work with X-windows, plain text terminals, or the web. This
is accomplished with three separate programs the interactive
interface (xtide), the non-interactive or command line interface
(tide), and the web interface.

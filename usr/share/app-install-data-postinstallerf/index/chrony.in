Comment3='
A client/server for the Network Time Protocol, this program keeps your
computers clock accurate. It was specially designed to support
systems with intermittent internet connections, but it also works well
in permanently connected environments. It can use also hardware reference
clocks, system real-time clock or manual input as time references.

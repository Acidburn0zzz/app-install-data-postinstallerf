Comment3='
The cptutils package contains a number of utilities for the manipulation of
color gradients; mainly for translating between different formats. Formats
supported include ggr (GIMP gradient), cpt (GMT color palette table),
avl (Arcview Legend), lut (xmedcon), svg, and version 3 of the grd format.

The cptutils package was written to aid the construction of the cpt archive
cpt-city http//soliton.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pub/cpt-city where thousands of
gradients can be downloaded.

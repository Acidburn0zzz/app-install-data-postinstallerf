KSig is a graphical tool for keeping track of many different email signatures.
The signatures themselves can be edited through KSigs graphical user
interface. A command-line interface is then available for generating random
or daily signatures from a list. The command-line interface makes a suitable
plugin for generating signatures in external mail clients such as KMail.

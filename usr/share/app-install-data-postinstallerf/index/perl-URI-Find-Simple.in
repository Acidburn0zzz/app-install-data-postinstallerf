URIFind is all very well, but sometimes you just want a list of the links
in a given piece of text, or you want to change all the URLs in some text
somehow, and dont want to mess with callback interfaces.

This module uses URIFind, but hides the callback interface, providing two
functions - one to list all the uris, and one to change all the uris.

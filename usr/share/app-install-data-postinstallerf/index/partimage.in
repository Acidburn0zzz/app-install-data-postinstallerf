Partimage is a Linux/UNIX partition imaging utility,
which saves partitions, having a supported filesystem, to an image file.
Partimage will only copy data from the used portions of the partition.
The image file can be compressed with gzip or bzip2 to save space,
and can be split into multiple files to be copied on CDs/DVDs.

Partimage was compiled with login enabled,
and supporting the following filesystems
  ext2fs, ext3fs, fat, fat16, fat32, hfs, hpfs, jfs,

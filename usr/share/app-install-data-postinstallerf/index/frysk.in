Frysk is an execution-analysis technology implemented using native
Java and C++.  It is aimed at providing developers and sysadmins with
the ability to both examine and analyze running multi-host,
multi-process, multi-threaded systems.  Frysk allows the monitoring of
running processes and threads, of locking primitives and will also
expose deadlocks, gather data and debug any given process in the
system.

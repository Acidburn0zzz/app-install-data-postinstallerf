MythTV provides a unified graphical interface for recording and viewing
television programs.  Refer to the mythtv package for more information.

This package contains only the server software, which provides video
and audio capture and encoding services.  In order to be useful, it
requires a mythtv-frontend installation, either on the same system or
one reachable via the network.

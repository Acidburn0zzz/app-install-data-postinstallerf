Comment3='
This module provides abstractions for JSON-RPC 1.0, 1.1 (both variations) and
2.0 (formerly 1.2) Procedure Call and Procedure Return objects (formerly known
as request and result), along with error objects.
It also provides marshaling objects to convert the model objects into JSON
text and HTTP requests/responses.

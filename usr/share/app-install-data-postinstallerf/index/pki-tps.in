Certificate System (CS) is an enterprise software system designed
to manage enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployments.

The Token Processing System (TPS) is an optional PKI subsystem that acts
as a Registration Authority (RA) for authenticating and processing
enrollment requests, PIN reset requests, and formatting requests from
the Enterprise Security Client (ESC).
TPS is designed to communicate with tokens that conform to
Global Platforms Open Platform Specification.

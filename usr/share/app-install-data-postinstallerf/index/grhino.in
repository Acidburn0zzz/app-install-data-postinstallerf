GRhino, or Rhino its former name, is a Reversi game on Linux and other
UNIX-like systems as long as GNOME 2 libraries are installed. It is currently
under development and a new version is available occasionally.

What distinguish GRhino from most other Reversi games is that GRhino will be
targeted for experienced Reversi players. Strong AI is the main focus with some
additional good, useful features (like an endgame solver) is planned. The
ultimate target strength of the AI is that it should be able to beat the best
human player at the highest difficulty level. Beating Logistello (the strongest
program available) is not in the plan )

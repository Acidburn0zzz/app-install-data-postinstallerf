Comment3='
The drbdlinks program manages links into a DRBD partition which is shared
among several machines. A simple configuration file, "/etc/drbdlinks.conf",
specifies the links. This can be used to manage e.g. links for /etc/httpd,
/var/lib/pgsql and other system directories that need to appear as if they
are local to the system when running applications after the drbd shared
partition has been mounted.

When running drbdlinks with "start" as the mode, drbdlinks will rename the
existing files/directories and then make symbolic links into the DRBD
partition, "stop" does the reverse. By default, rename appends ".drbdlinks"

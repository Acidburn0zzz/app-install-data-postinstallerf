StringFormatter is a tool for building sprintf-like formatting routines.
It supports named or positional formatting, custom conversions, fixed
string interpolation, and simple width-matching out of the box. It is easy
to alter its behavior to write new kinds of format string expanders. For
most cases, it should be easy to build all sorts of formatters out of the
options built into StringFormatter.

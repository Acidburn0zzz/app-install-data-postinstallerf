Think of Spotify as your new music collection. Your library. Only
this time your collection is vast millions of tracks and counting.
Spotify comes in all shapes and sizes, available for your PC, Mac,
home audio system and mobile phone. Wherever you go, your music
follows you. And because the music plays live, there?s no need to wait
for downloads and no big dent in your hard drive.

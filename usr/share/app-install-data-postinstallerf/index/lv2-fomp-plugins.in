Fomp is an LV2 port of the MCP, VCO, FIL, and WAH plugins by Fons Adriaensen.

There are 13 plugins in total 1 auto-wah, 1 EQ, 3 chorus, 5 filters, and 3
oscillators.
The plugin implementations are identical to their LADSPA forebears, except
the primary frequency port of oscillators and filters has been converted to
Hz to facilitate use in any host without assuming the hidden tuning frequency
of AlsaModularSynth. All other frequency ports remain as they were, using
octaves for faithful Moog-like modulation.

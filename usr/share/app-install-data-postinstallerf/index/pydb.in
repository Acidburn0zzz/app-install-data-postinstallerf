Comment3='
Extended Python Debugger is a more complete debugger for Python
than the stock pdb.py debugger. It supports a "restart" command,
non-interactive POSIX-like line tracing, command options, disassembly
of instructions, and stack traces that give better information for exec
statements. Stepping/nexting skips over method/function "defs". It tries
to follow gdbs command set, unless there is a good reason not to.

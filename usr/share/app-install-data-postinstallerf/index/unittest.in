Comment3='
Unittest is a C++ unit test framework. Its design goals are to be simple, to
be idiomatic C++, and to follow the basic xUnit style to the extent that doing
so is compatible with the earlier goals. Its main differences from other xUnit
frameworks are that it uses constructors and destructors for setup/teardown
and that it requires you to represent tests as classes, instead of methods.

Rawstudio is a highly specialized application for processing RAW images
from digital cameras. It is not a fully featured image editing application.

The RAW format is often recommended to get the best quality out of digital
camera images.  The format is specific to cameras and cannot be read by most
image editing applications.
Rawstudio makes it possible to read and manipulate RAW images, experiment
with the controls to see how they affect the image, and finally export into
JPEG, PNG or TIF format images from most digital cameras.

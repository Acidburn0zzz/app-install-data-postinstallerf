Comment3='
NEXT was a good solution a few years ago, but isnt any more. Its
slow, and the order in which it re-dispatches methods appears random
at times. It also encourages bad programming practices, as you end up
with code to redispatch methods when all you really wanted to do was
run some code before or after a method fired.  However, if you have a large
application, then weaning yourself off NEXT isnt easy.This module is
intended as a drop-in replacement for NEXT, supporting the same interface,
but using ClassC3 to do the hard work. You can then write new code
without NEXT, and migrate individual source files to use ClassC3
or method modifiers as appropriate, at whatever pace youre comfortable with.

Solaar is a Linux device manager for Logitech?s Unifying Receiver
peripherals. It is able to pair/unpair devices to the receiver, and
for most devices read battery status.

It comes in two flavors, command-line and GUI. Both are able to list
the devices paired to a Unifying Receiver, show detailed info for
each device, and also pair/unpair supported devices with the receiver.

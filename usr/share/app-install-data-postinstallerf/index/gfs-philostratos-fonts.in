Comment3='
Griechische Antiqua was one of the historical Greek typefaces of the late 19th
and early 20th century. It was designed by ?aurice ?duard Pinder, a German
erudite artist and a member of the Academy of Science in Berlin. This is the
most popular version which has appeared from 1870 to 1940 in the German
speaking philological literature and in many classical and Byzantine editions
by publishers like Teubner (in Leipzig) and Weidmann (in Berlin) such as
Anthology of Byzantine Melos by Wilhelm von Christ and Matthaios
Paranikas (Leipzig 1871), Epicurea, by Heinrich Usener (Leipzig 1887),
Mitrodorous by Alfred Koerte (Leipzig 1890), Pindar by Otto Schroeder (Leipzig
1908), ??? Aeschylus by U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff (Berlin 1910, 1915),

Jar Jar Links is a utility that makes it easy to repackage Java
libraries and embed them into your own distribution. This is
useful for two reasons
You can easily ship a single jar file with no external dependencies.
You can avoid problems where your library depends on a specific
version of a library, which may conflict with the dependencies of
another library.

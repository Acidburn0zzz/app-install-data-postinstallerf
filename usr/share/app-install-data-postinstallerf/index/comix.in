Comix is a user-friendly, customizable image viewer.
It is specifically designed to handle comic books, but
also serves as a generic viewer. It reads images in ZIP,
RAR or tar archives (also gzip or bzip2 compressed) as
well as plain image files. It is written in Python and
uses GTK+ through the PyGTK bindings.

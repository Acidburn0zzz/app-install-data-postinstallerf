PNMixer is system tray sound mixer. Currently it supports ALSA and PulseAudio.
It is written in C, depends only on GTK+, and does not require Gnome.

PNMixer is a fork of OBMixer with a number of additions. These include
* Volume adjustment with the scroll wheel
* Textual display of volume level in popup window
* Continuous volume adjustment when dragging the slider (not just when you let
  go)
* Use system icon theme for icons and use mute/low/medium/high volume icons
* Configurable middle click action (default is mute/unmute)

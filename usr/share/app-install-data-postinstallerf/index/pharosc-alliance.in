The libraries have been characterised in a generic 0.13?m
technology. The spice model comes from the University of California,
Berkeley, and the layout rules are slightly oversized 0.13?m ones
which should make the layout compatible with most foundry rules

The vxlib is compatible with the sxlib created by the Alliance
software authors. The vsclib is a completely new library design.
The wsclib is derived from the vsclib. The rgalib and vgalib are
small gate array type libraries.

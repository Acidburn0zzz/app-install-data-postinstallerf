Comment3='
Zend Framework 2.0 introduces a new and powerful approach to modules. This new
module system is designed with flexibility, simplicity, and re-usability in
mind. A module may contain just about anything PHP code, including MVC
functionality; library code; view scripts; and/or public assets such as images,
CSS, and JavaScript.

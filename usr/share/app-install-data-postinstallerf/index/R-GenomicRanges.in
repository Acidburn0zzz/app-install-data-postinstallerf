The ability to efficiently store genomic annotations and alignments is
playing a central role when it comes to analyze high-throughput sequencing
data (a.k.a. NGS data). The package defines general purpose containers for
storing genomic intervals as well as more specialized containers for
storing alignments against a reference genome.

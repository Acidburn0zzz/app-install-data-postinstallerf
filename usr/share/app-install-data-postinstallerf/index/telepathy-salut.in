telepathy-salut is a Telepathy connection manager for link-local XMPP.
Normally, XMPP does not support direct client-to-client interactions,
since it requires authentication with a server.  This package makes
it is possible to establish an XMPP-like communications system on a
local network using zero-configuration networking.

Comment3='
Dislocker has been designed to read BitLocker encrypted partitions ("drives")
under a Linux system. The driver used to only read volumes encrypted under a
Microsoft Windows 7 system but is now Microsoft Windows Vista capable and has
the write functionality.

A mount point needs to be given to fuse-dislocker. Once keys are decrypted, a
file named dislocker-file appears into this provided mount point. This file
is a virtual NTFS partition, it can be mounted as any NTFS partition and then
reading from it or writing to it is possible.

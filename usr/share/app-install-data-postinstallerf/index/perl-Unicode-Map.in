Comment3='
This module converts strings from and to 2-byte Unicode UCS2
format. All mappings happen via 2 byte UTF16 encodings, not via 1 byte
UTF8 encoding. To convert between UTF8 and UTF16 use UnicodeString.
For historical reasons this module coexists with UnicodeMap8.
Please use UnicodeMap8 unless you need to care for >1 byte character
sets, e.g. chinese GB2312. Anyway, if you stick to the basic
functionality (see documentation) you can use both modules
equivalently.
Practically this module will disappear from earth sooner or later as
Unicode mapping support needs somehow to get into perls core. If you

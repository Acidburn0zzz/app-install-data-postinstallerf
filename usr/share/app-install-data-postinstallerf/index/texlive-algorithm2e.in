Algorithm2e is an environment for writing algorithms. An
algorithm becomes a floating object (like figure, table, etc.).
The package provides macros that allow you to create different
keywords, and a set of predefined key words is provided; you
can change the typography of the keywords. The package allows
vertical lines delimiting a block of instructions in an
algorithm, and defines different sorts of algorithms such as
Procedure or Function; the name of these functions may be
reused in the text or in other algorithms.

Monolog sends your logs to files, sockets, inboxes, databases and various web
services. Special handlers allow you to build advanced logging strategies.

This library implements the PSR-3 [1] interface that you can type-hint against
in your own libraries to keep a maximum of interoperability. You can also use it
in your applications to make sure you can always use another compatible logger
at a later time.
Optional
* php-aws-sdk (>= 2.4.9, < 3.0)

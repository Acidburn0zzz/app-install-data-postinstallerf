Bottle-sqlite is a plugin that integrates SQLite3 with your Bottle application.
It automatically connects to a database at the beginning of a request, passes
the database handle to the route callback and closes the connection afterwards.

To automatically detect routes that need a database connection, the plugin
searches for route callbacks that require a db keyword argument (configurable)
and skips routes that do not. This removes any overhead for routes that dont
need a database connection.

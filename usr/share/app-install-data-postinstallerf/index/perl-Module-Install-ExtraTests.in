This allows extra_tests; to be declared in Makefile.PL, indicating that the
test files found in the directory ./xt should be run only in certain
instances

  ./xt/author  - run when the tests are being run in an authors working copy
  ./xt/smoke   - run when the dist is being smoked (AUTOMATED_TESTING=1)
  ./xt/release - run during "make disttest"

SezPoz is a lightweight and easy-to-learn library that lets you
perform modular service lookups. It provides some of the same
capabilities as (for example) java.util.ServiceLoader, but SezPoz
has some special advantages. The service registrations are made
just using type-checked Java annotations. There are no configuration
files to edit.

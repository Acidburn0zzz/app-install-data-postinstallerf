The Schr?dinger project will implement portable libraries for the high
quality Dirac video codec created by BBC Research and
Development. Dirac is a free and open source codec producing very high
image quality video.

The Schr?dinger project is a project done by BBC R&D and Fluendo in
order to create a set of high quality decoder and encoder libraries
for the Dirac video codec.

Comment3='
The IOAll object is a proxy for IOFile, IODir, IOSocket,
IOString, TieFile, FileSpec, FilePath and FileReadBackwards; as
well as all the DBM and MLDBM modules. You can use most of the methods
found in these classes and in IOHandle (which they inherit from). IOAll
adds dozens of other helpful idiomatic methods including file stat and
manipulation functions.

ReMoot is a remote control that supports many popular multimedia applications
running on GNU/Linux. It wraps around these apps and provides a unified and
easy-to-use interface which can be accessed in many different ways. You can
use the remote control from the command-line, with desktop icons or panel
buttons, over the web with "rewwwoot" or by mapping your multimedia keyboard
to it so that you can control all supported applications with the same keys.

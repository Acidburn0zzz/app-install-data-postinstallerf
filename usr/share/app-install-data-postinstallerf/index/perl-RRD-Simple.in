RRDSimple provides a simple interface to RRDTools RRDs module. This module
does not currently offer the fetch method that is available in the RRDs
module. It does, however, create RRD files with a sensible set of default RRA
Round Robin Archive) definitions, and can dynamically add new data source
names to an existing RRD file.

This module is ideal for quick and simple storage of data within an RRD file
if you do not need to, nor want to, bother defining custom RRA definitions.

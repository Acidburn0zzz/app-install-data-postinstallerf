WebFlash is a library to display "flash" messages in python web applications.
These messages are usually used to provide feedback to the user (eg you
changes have been saved, your credit card number has been stolen, ...). One
important characteristic they must provide is the ability to survive a redirect
(ie display the message in a page after being redirected from a form
submission).

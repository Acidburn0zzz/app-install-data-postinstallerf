Comment3='
Boa is a single-tasking HTTP server. That means that unlike traditional web
servers, it does not fork for each incoming connection, nor does it fork many
copies of itself to handle multiple connections. It internally multiplexes
all of the ongoing HTTP connections, and forks only for CGI programs (which
must be separate processes), automatic directory generation, and automatic
file gunzipping.
The primary design goals of Boa are speed and security. Security, in the sense
of "cant be subverted by a malicious user," not "fine grained access control
and encrypted communications". Boa is not intended as a feature-packed server.

batctl offers a convenient way to configure the batman-adv kernel module
as well as displaying debug information such as originator tables,
translation tables and the debug log. In combination with a bat-hosts
file batctl allows the use of host names instead of MAC addresses.

B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced operates on layer 2. Thus all hosts participating
in the virtual switched network are transparently connected together
for all protocols above layer 2. Therefore the common diagnosis tools
do not work as expected. To overcome these problems batctl contains the
commands ping, traceroute, tcpdump which provide similar functionality

Comment3='
A fast, open source text processor and publishing toolchain, written in Ruby,
for transforming AsciiDoc markup into HTML 5, DocBook 4.5, DocBook 5.0 and
custom output formats. The transformation from AsciiDoc to custom output
formats is performed by running the nodes in the parsed document tree through a
collection of templates written in a template language supported by Tilt.

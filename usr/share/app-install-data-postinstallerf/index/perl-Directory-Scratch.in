Comment3='
When writing test suites for modules that operate on files, its often
inconvenient to correctly create a platform-independent temporary storage
space, manipulate files inside it, then clean it up when the test exits.
The inconvenience usually results in tests that don?t work everwhere, or
worse, no tests at all.

This module aims to eliminate that problem by making it easy to do things
right.

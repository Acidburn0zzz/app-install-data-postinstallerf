Comment3='
The CollabNet Merge Client has been built on top of Eclipse and Subclipse.
This combination allowed us to support multiple client operating systems and
also allowed us to focus on the actual merge client and merge process while
leveraging the excellent Subversion capabilities that already exist in
Subclipse. This gives you a powerful client that allows you to perform all
Subversion operations from a single tool. Commit, History, Blame, Switch,
Tagging. Everything you need is available. You do not have to be an Eclipse
shop or even an Eclipse developer to use the client. Eclipse and Subclipse
make it easy to checkout and access any project in your repository. You can
just use the client as a general Subversion UI, or even just to perform merges.

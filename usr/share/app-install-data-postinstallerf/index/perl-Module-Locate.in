Comment3='
Using "locate()", return the path that "require" would find for a given
module or filename (it can also return a filehandle if a reference in @INC
has been used).  This means you can test for the existence, or find the
path for, modules without having to evaluate the code they contain.

This module also comes with accompanying utility functions that are used
within the module itself (except for "get_source") and are available for
import.

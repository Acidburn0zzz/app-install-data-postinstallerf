The Java TNEF package is an open source code implementation of a TNEF message
handler, which can be used as a command-line utility or integrated into Java-
based mail applications to extract the original message content.

Transport-Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF) is Microsofts non-standard
format for encapsulating mail which has any non-plain-text content or
properties (such as rich text, embedded OLE objects, voting buttons, and
sometimes just attachments). Whether or not a given message is encoded using
TNEF is determined by the Outlook default settings, per-recipient setting,
Exchange Server settings, and message type and content.

Comment3='
This module does not provide a one-to-one mapping of the Lab Manager SOAP
API, but rather it provides an API wrapper, which combines certain SOAP
calls as a meaningful single operation. Thus this module is heavily
tailored for automation purposes. But, it should also cater to the
broader audience as it still does provide overall functionality that
might be required.

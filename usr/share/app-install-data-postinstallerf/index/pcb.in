PCB is an interactive printed circuit board editor.
PCB includes a rats nest feature, design rule checking, and can provide
industry standard RS-274-X (Gerber), NC drill, and centroid data (X-Y data)
output for use in the board fabrication and assembly process. PCB offers
high end features such as an autorouter and trace optimizer which can
tremendously reduce layout time.

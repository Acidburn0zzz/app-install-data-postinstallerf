dt is a generic data test program used to verify proper operation of
peripherals, file systems, device drivers, or any data stream supported by the
operating system. In its simplest mode of operation, dt writes and then
verifies its default data pattern, then displays performance statistics and
other test parameters before exiting. Since verification of data is performed,
dt can be thought of as a generic diagnostic tool.

dt command lines are similar to the dd program, which is popular on most UNIX
systems. It contains numerous options to give the user control of various test
parameters.

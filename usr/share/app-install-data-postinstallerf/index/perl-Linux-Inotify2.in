Comment3='
This module implements an interface to the Linux 2.6.13+
Inotify file/directory change notification sytem.  It has a
number of advantages over the LinuxInotify module
   - it is portable (LinuxInotify only works on x86)
   - the equivalent of fullname works correctly
   - it is better documented
   - it has callback-style interface, which is better suited for
     integration.

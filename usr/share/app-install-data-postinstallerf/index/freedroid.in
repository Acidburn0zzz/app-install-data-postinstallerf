Comment3='
This is a clone of the classic game "Paradroid" on Commodore 64
with some improvements and extensions to the classic version.
In this game, you control a robot, depicted by a small white ball with
a few numbers within an interstellar spaceship consisting of several
decks connected by elevators.
The aim of the game is to destroy all enemy robots, depicted by small
black balls with a few numbers, by either shooting them or seizing
control over them by creating connections in a short subgame of
electric circuits.

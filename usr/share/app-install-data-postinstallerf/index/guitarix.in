Guitarix is a simple mono amplifier to be used in a JACKified environment,
i.e. a system using the JACK Audio Connection Kit, a professionally-capable
audio/MIDI server and master transport control.

Guitarix provides one JACK input port and two JACK output ports. It is designed
to produce nice trash/metal/rock/blues guitar sounds. Controls for bass, treble,
gain, compressor, preamp, balance, distortion, freeverb, crybaby (wah) and echo
are available. A fixed resonator is used when distortion is disabled. To modify
the sound pressure, you can use the feedback and feedforward sliders.

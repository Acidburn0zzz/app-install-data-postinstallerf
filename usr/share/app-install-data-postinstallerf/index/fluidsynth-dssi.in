This is an implementation of the FluidSynth soundfont-playing software
synthesizer as a DSSI plugin. It makes use of DSSIs run_multiple_synths()
soundfont data is shared between instances, and FluidSynths usual voice
allocation methods are applied across multiple instances as if each were a
FluidSynth channel.

Comment3='
HERMES is a library designed to convert a source buffer with a specified pixel
format to a destination buffer with possibly a different format at the maximum
possible speed.

On x86 and MMX architectures, handwritten assembler routines are taking over
the job and doing it lightning fast.
On top of that, HERMES provides fast surface clearing, stretching and some
dithering. Supported platforms are basically all that have an ANSI C compiler
as there is no platform specific code but those are supported DOS, Win32

Snap! is a system snapshot utility which uses the underlying package
management system and native tooling to take and restore system snapshots.

It provides a very simple command line and graphical interface as well as
an API which can be easily extended to take snapshots of any custom system
entity (support for repositories, packages, files, and various services are
provided right out of the box)

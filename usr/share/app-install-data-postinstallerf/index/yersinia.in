Yersinia is a network tool designed to take advantage of some weakeness
in different network protocols. It pretends to be a solid framework for
analyzing and testing the deployed networks and systems.

Currently, there are some network protocols implemented, but others are
coming (tell us which one is your preferred). Attacks for the following
network protocols are implemented (but of course you are free for
implementing new ones)
* Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

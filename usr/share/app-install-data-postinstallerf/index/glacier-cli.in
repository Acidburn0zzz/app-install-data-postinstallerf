This tool provides a sysadmin-friendly command line interface to Amazon
Glacier, turning Glacier into an easy-to-use storage backend. It automates
tasks which would otherwise require a number of separate steps (job submission,
polling for job completion and retrieving the results of jobs). It provides
integration with git-annex, making Glacier even more useful.

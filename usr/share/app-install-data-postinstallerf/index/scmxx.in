SCMxx is a console program that allows you to exchange certain types of
data with mobile phones made by Siemens. Some of the data types that can be
exchanged are logos, ring tones, vCalendars, phonebook entries, and short
messages. Other actions like setting the time and dialling a number are also
possible.

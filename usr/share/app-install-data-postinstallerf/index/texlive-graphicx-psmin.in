This package is an extension of the standard graphics bundle
and provides a way to include repeated PostScript graphics (ps,
eps) only once in a PostScript document. This provides a way to
get smaller PostScript documents when having, for instance, a
logo on every page. This package only works when post-processed
with dvips, which should at least have version 5.95b. The
difference for a resulting distilled PDF file is minimal (as
Ghostscript and Adobe Distiller only include a single copy of
each graphics file, anyway).

Modules that provide OS-specific behaviors often need to know if the current
operating system matches a more generic type of operating systems. For example,
linux is a type of Unix operating system and so is freebsd.

This module provides a mapping between an operating system name as given by $^O
and a more generic type. The initial version is based on the OS type mappings
provided in ModuleBuild and ExtUtilsCBuilder (thus, Microsoft operating
systems are given the type Windows rather than Win32).

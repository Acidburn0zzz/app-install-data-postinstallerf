Crack is a password guessing program that is designed to quickly locate
insecurities in Unix (or other) password files by scanning the contents of a
password file, looking for users who have misguidedly chosen a weak login
password.

This package creates a group named "crack" and the Crack program puts all
its results in the /var/lib/crack/run directory, which belongs to that group.
Only users in the crack group can use this package.

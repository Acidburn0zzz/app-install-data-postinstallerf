The package helps to typeset exercises or list of exercises
within any document. Exercises, questions and sub-questions are
automatically numbered. It is possible to put answers in the
same document, and display them immediatly, later in the
document or not to print answers at all. The layout of
exercises is fully customisable. It is possible to typeset long
problems, short exercises, questionnaires, etc. Usage of the
babel package is detected, but not fully supported yet (only
English and French are implemented).

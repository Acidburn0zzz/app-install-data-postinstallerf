This application provides a way to unpack Microsoft MS-TNEF MIME attachments.
It operates like tar in order to unpack files of type "application/ms-tnef",
which may have been placed into the MS-TNEF attachment instead of being
attached separately.

Such files may have attachment names similar to WINMAIL.DAT

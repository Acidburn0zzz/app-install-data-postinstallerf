Comment3='
Hirwen Harendal started in 1999 the realization of a first font family, aiming
to create another ?Times New Roman?? He does not consider this endeavour a huge
success. However, he transformed Tribun progessively since then to give it its
own character.

The idea was to achieve newsprint-like rendering. To this effect, the glyph
bodies, serifs, or even extenders are not normalised and use irregular strokes.
This is most visible in italics though those variations stay imperceptible at
small sizes.

This package contains the main HTML5 web application for the Guacamole stack
that provides access to desktop environments using remote desktop protocols such
as VNC or RDP.

A centralized server acts as a tunnel and proxy, allowing access to multiple
desktops through a web browser. No plugins are needed the client requires
nothing more than a web browser supporting HTML5 and AJAX.
The centralized server is provided by the "guacd" package and its associated
"libguac-client-*" packages.

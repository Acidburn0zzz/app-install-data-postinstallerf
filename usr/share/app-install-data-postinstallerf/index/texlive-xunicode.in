The package supports XeTeXs (and other putative future similar
engines) need for Unicode characters, in a similar way to what
the fontenc does for 8-bit (and the like) fonts convert
accent-glyph sequence to a single Unicode character for output.
The package also covers glyphs specified by packages (such as
tipa) which define many commands for single text glyphs.

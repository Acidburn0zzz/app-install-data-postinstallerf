Comment3='
Spectrwm is a small dynamic tiling window manager for X11.
It tries to stay out of the way so that valuable screen real
estate can be used for much more important stuff.
It has sane defaults and does not require one to learn a
language to do any configuration. It was written by hackers
for hackers and it strives to be small, compact and fast.

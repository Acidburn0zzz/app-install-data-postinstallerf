This module implements a parser to convert Pod documents into a simple
object model form known hereafter as the Pod Object Model.  The object
model is generated as a hierarchical tree of nodes, each of which
represents a different element of the original document.  The tree can
be walked manually and the nodes examined, printed or otherwise
manipulated.  In addition, PodPOM supports and provides view objects
which can automatically traverse the tree, or section thereof, and
generate an output representation in one form or another.

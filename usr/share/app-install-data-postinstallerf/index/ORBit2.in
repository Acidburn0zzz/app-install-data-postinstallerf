ORBit is a high-performance CORBA (Common Object Request Broker
Architecture) ORB (object request broker). It allows programs to
send requests and receive replies from other programs, regardless
of the locations of the two programs. CORBA is an architecture that
enables communication between program objects, regardless of the
programming language theyre written in or the operating system they
run on.

You will need to install this package and ORBit-devel if you want to
write programs that use CORBA technology.

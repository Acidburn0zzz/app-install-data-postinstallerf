GTK-perl renderer for *DataTreeDumper*.

This widget is the gui equivalent of DataTreeDumper; it will display a
perl data structure in a TreeView, allowing you to fold and unfold child
data structures and get a quick feel for whats where. Right-clicking
anywhere in the view brings up a context menu, from which the user can
choose to expand or collapse all items.

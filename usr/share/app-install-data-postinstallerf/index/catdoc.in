Comment3='
catdoc is program which reads one or more Microsoft word files
and outputs text, contained insinde them to standard output.
Therefore it does same work for.doc files, as unix cat
command for plain ASCII files.
It is now accompanied by xls2csv - program which converts
Excel spreadsheet into comma-separated value file,
and catppt - utility to extract textual information
from Powerpoint files

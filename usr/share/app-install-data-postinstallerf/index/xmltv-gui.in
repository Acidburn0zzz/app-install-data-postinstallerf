XMLTV is a set of utilities to manage your TV viewing. They work with
TV listings stored in the XMLTV format, which is based on XML. The
idea is to separate out the backend (getting the listings) from the
frontend (displaying them for the user), and to implement useful
operations like picking out your favourite programmes as filters that
read and write XML documents.

This package contains graphical frontends to xmltv.

Comment3='
Yadex is a Doom level (wad) editor for Unix systems running X, including Linux.
It supports Doom alpha, Doom beta, Doom, Ultimate Doom, Final Doom, Doom II,
Heretic and also, in a more or less limited way, Hexen and Strife.

Yadex is descended from DEU 5.21. Therefore, as you might expect, its a rather
low-level editor that requires you to take care of a lot of detail but on the
flip side allows you to control very precisely what you are doing. In addition,
it has many advanced functions that DEU didnt have, to make certain
tedious tasks easy.

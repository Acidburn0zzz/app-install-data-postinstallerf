This package is constructed on top of the MPI-1/MPI-2 specification and
provides an object oriented interface which closely follows MPI-2 C++
bindings. It supports point-to-point (sends, receives) and collective
(broadcasts, scatters, gathers) communications of any picklable Python
object as well as optimized communications of Python object exposing the
single-segment buffer interface (NumPy arrays, built-in bytes/string/array
objects).

This package contains mpi4py compiled against MPICH.

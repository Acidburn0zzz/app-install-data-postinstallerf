GeanyPy is based on the upstream at https//github.com/codebrainz/geanypy which
is still under development, however it is useful as is. Parts of the existing
API which mirror the Geany C API will probably not change unless the Geany API
changes, however new API may be added. Also documentation is needed, contributions
are welcome.

Detailed information can be found in the documentation directory and at
http//plugins.geany.org/geanypy.html

Long Range ZIP or Lzma RZIP

This is a compression program optimized for large files. The larger the file
and the more memory you have, the better the compression advantage this will
provide, especially once the files are larger than 100 MB. The advantage can
be chosen to be either size (much smaller than bzip2) or speed (much faster
than bzip2). Decompression is always much faster than bzip2.

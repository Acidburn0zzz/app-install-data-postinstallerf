Prover9 is an automated theorem prover for first-order and equational logic.
It is a successor of the Otter prover. Prover9 uses the inference techniques
of ordered resolution and paramodulation with literal selection.

This package provides documentation for Prover9, Mace4 and other associated
programs.

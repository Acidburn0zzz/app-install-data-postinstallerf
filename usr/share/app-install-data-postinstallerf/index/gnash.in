Gnash is capable of reading up to SWF v9 files and op-codes, but primarily
supports SWF v7, with better SWF v8 and v9 support under heavy development.
Gnash includes initial parser support for SWF v8 and v9. Not all
ActionScript 2 classes are implemented yet, but all of the most heavily
used ones are. Many ActionScript 2 classes are partially implemented;
there is support for all of the commonly used methods of each
class.

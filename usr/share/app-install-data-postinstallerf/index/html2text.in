html2text is a command line utility that converts HTML documents into
plain text.
Each HTML document is read from standard input or a (local or remote)
URI, and formatted into a stream of plain text characters that is written
to standard output or into an output-file. The program preserves the
original positions of table fields and accepts also syntactically
incorrect input, attempting to interpret it "reasonably". The rendering
is largely customisable through an RC file.

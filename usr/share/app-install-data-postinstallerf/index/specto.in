Specto is a desktop application that will watch configurable events
(such as website updates, emails, file and folder changes,
system processes, etc) and then trigger notifications.

Specto can watch a website for updates and notify you when
there is activity (otherwise, Specto will just stay out of the way).
This changes the way you work, because you can be informed
of events instead of having to look out for them.

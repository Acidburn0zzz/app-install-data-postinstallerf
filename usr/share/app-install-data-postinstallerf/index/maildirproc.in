maildirproc is a program that processes one or several existing mail boxes in
the maildir format. It is primarily focused on mail sorting, which means
moving, copying, forwarding, and deleting mail according to a set of rules.
It can be seen as an alternative to procmail, but instead of being a delivery
agent (which wants to be part of the delivery chain), maildirproc only
processes mail which has already been delivered. That is a feature, not a bug.

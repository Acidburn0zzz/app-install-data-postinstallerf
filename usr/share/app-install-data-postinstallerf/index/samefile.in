Comment3='
The samefile utility finds files with identical contents, independent of file
name. This program is for you if you are notoriously low on disk space, keep
exceeding your disk quota, pay for your storage by the megabyte, run any kind
of file server, need to reduce the size of your backups, or just want to get
a feeling for how much redundant files are there on your system.

Pinlabel is a labelling package for attaching perfectly
formatted TeX labels to figures and diagrams in both eps and
pdf formats. It is suitable both for labelling a new diagram
and for relabelling an existing diagram. The package uses
coordinates derived from GhostView (or gv) and labels are
placed with automatic and consistent spacing relative to the
object labelled.

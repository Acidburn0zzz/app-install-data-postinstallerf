Comment3='
There is one open-source C++ parser, the C++ front-end to GCC, which
is currently able to deal with the language in its entirety. The
purpose of the GCC-XML extension is to generate an XML description of
a C++ program from GCCs internal representation. Since XML is easy to
parse, other development tools will be able to work with C++ programs
without the burden of a complicated C++ parser.

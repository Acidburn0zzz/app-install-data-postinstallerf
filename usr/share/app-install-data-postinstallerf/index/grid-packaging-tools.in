GPT is a collection of packaging tools built around an XML based
packaging data format. This format provides a straight forward way to
define complex dependency and compatibility relationships between
packages. The tools provide a means for developers to easily define the
packaging data and include it as part of their source code distribution.
Binary packages can be automatically generated from this data. The
packages defined by GPT are compatible with other packages and can be
easily converted.

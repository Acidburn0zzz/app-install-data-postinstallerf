Apache XML Graphics Commons is a library that consists of
several reusable components used by Apache Batik and
Apache FOP. Many of these components can easily be used
separately outside the domains of SVG and XSL-FO. You will
find components such as a PDF library, an RTF library,
Graphics2D implementations that let you generate PDF &
PostScript files, and much more.

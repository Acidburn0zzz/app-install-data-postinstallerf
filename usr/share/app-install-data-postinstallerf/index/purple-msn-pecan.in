The project aims to have a much faster development process, low barrier for
contributions, and close contact with the user-base.

Compared to Pidgins official MSN plug-in
	* Faster log-in
	* Fewer connection issues
	* Fewer crashes
	* Experimental direct connection support (fast file transfers)
	* Server-side storage for display names (private alias)
	* Support for handwritten messages (read-only)

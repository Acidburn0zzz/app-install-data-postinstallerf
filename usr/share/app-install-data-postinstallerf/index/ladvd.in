ladvd uses CDP / LLDP frames to inform switches about connected hosts, which
simplifies Ethernet switch management. Every 30 seconds it will transmit CDP/
LLDP packets reflecting the current system state. Interfaces (bridge, bonding,
wireless), capabilities (bridging, forwarding, wireless) and addresses (IPv4,
IPv6) are detected dynamically.

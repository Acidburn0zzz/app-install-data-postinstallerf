Pamtester is a tiny program to test the Pluggable Authentication Modules
(PAM) facility, which is a de facto standard of unified authentication
management mechanism in many Unixes and similar OSes including Solaris,
HP-UX, *BSD, MacOSX and Linux. While specifically designed to help PAM
module authors to test their modules, that might also be handy for system
administrators interested in building a centralised authentication system
using common standards such as NIS, SASL and LDAP.

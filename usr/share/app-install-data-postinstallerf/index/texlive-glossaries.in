The glossaries package supports acronyms and multiple
glossaries, and has provision for operation in several
languages (using the facilities of either babel or
polyglossia). New entries are defined to have a name and
description (and optionally an associated symbol). Support for
multiple languages is offered, and plural forms of terms may be
specified. An additional package, glossaries-accsupp, can make
use of the accsupp package mechanisms for accessibility support
for PDF files containing glossaries. The user may define new
glossary styles, and preambles and postambles can be specified.

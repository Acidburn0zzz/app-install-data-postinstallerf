The goal of the HCT is to generate scores that represent
the complexity of the constituent modules of large
integrated circuit design projects ? i.e. SOCs. The designs
complexity scores are useful to verification
teams so as to efficiently focus resources based on the dynamic
complexity profile of a design. The scores are a useful tool to guide
HDL designers re-factoring efforts.

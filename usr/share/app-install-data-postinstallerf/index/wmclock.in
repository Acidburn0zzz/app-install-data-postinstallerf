Comment3='
Wmclock is an applet which displays the date and time in a dockable
tile in the same style as the clock from the N*XTSTEP operating
system.  Wmclock is specially designed for the WindowMaker window
manager, by Alfredo Kojima, and features multiple language support,
twenty-four-hour and twelve-hour (am/pm) time display, and, optionally,
can run a user-specified program on a mouse click.  Wmclock is derived
from asclock, a similar clock for the AfterStep window manager.

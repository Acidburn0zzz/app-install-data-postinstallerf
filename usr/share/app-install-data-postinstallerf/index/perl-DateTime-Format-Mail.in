Comment3='
RFCs 2822 and 822 specify date formats to be used by email. This module parses
and emits such dates.

RFC2822 (April 2001) introduces a slightly different format of date than that
used by RFC822 (August 1982). The main correction is that the preferred format
is more limited, and thus easier to parse programmatically.
Despite the ease of generating and parsing perfectly valid RFC822 and RFC2822
people still get it wrong. This module aims to correct that.

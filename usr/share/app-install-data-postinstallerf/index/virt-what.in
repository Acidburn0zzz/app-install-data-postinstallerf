virt-what is a shell script which can be used to detect if the program
is running in a virtual machine.

The program prints out a list of "facts" about the virtual machine,
derived from heuristics.  One fact is printed per line.
If nothing is printed and the script exits with code 0 (no error),
then it can mean either that the program is running on bare-metal or
the program is running inside a type of virtual machine which we dont
know about or cant detect.

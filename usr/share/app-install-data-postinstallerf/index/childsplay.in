Childsplay is a suite of educational games for young children. Its written in
Python and uses the SDL-libraries. The aim is to be educational and at the same
time be fun to play.

Some activities make use of language dependent voice samples, these sounds are
available as childsplay-alphabet_sounds packages. For those youll have to
install the childsplay-alphabet_sounds package for the languages you intend to
use. For example childsplay-alphabet_sounds_nl.

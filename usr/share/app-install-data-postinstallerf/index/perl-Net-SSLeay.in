This module offers some high level convenience functions for accessing
web pages on SSL servers (for symmetry, same API is offered for
accessing http servers, too), a sslcat() function for writing your own
clients, and finally access to the SSL API of SSLeay/OpenSSL package
so you can write servers or clients for more complicated applications.

RPly is a library that lets applications read and write PLY files.
The PLY file format is widely used to store geometric information, such as 3D
models, but is general enough to be useful for other purposes.

RPly is easy to use, well documented, small, free, open-source, ANSI C,
efficient, and well tested. The highlights are
* A callback mechanism that makes PLY file input straightforward;
* Support for the full range of numeric formats;
* Binary (big and little endian) and text modes are fully supported;

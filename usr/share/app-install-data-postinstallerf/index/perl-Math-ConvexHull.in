Comment3='
MathConvexHull is a simple module that calculates convex hulls from a set
of points in 2D space. It is a straightforward implementation of the
algorithm known as Grahams scan which, with complexity of O(n*log(n)), is
the fastest known method of finding the convex hull of an arbitrary set of
points. There are some methods of eliminating points that cannot be part of
the convex hull. These may or may not be implemented in a future version.

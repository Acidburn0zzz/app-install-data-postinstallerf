Live, the "Live Interactive VDR Environment", is a plugin providing the
possibility to interactively control the VDR and some of its plugins by
a web interface.

Unlike external utility programs that communicate with VDR and its plugins
by SVDRP, Live has direct access to VDRs data structures and is thus very
fast.

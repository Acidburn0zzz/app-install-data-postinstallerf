xrick is a clone of Rick Dangerous. Written entirely in C, it relies
on the Simple DirectMedia Layer library and has been ported to Linux
(its primary target). Way before Lara Croft, back in the 1980s and
early 1990s, Rick Dangerous was the Indiana Jones of computer games,
running away from rolling rocks and avoiding traps in places from
South America to a futuristic missile base via Egypt and the
Schwarzendumpf castle.

Comment3='
Thunar is a new modern file manager for the Xfce Desktop Environment. It has
been designed from the ground up to be fast and easy-to-use. Its user interface
is clean and intuitive, and does not include any confusing or useless options.
Thunar is fast and responsive with a good start up time and directory load time.

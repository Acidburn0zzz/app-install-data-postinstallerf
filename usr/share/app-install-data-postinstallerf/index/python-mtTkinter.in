Although Tkinter is technically thread-safe
practically speaking there are still problems when used in multithreaded
Python applications.  The problems stem from the fact that the _tkinter
module attempts to gain control of the main thread via a polling technique
when processing calls from other threads.  If it succeeds, all is well.
If it fails (i.e., after a timeout), the application receives an exception
with the message "RuntimeError main thread is not in main loop".
There is no way to tell when this might happen, so calling Tk routines
from multiple threads seems to be problematic at best.

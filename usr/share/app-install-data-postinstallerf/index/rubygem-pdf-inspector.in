This library provides a number of PDFReader[0] based tools for use in
testing PDF output.  Presently, the primary purpose of this tool is to
support the tests found in Prawn[1], a pure Ruby PDF generation library.
However, it may be useful to others, so we have made it available as
a gem in its own right.

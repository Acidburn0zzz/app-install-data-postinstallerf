This module provides an easy way to access/create XML data. Its based on a
HASH tree created from the XML data, and enables dynamic access to it
through the standard Perl syntax for Hash and Array, without necessarily
caring about which you are working with. In other words, each point in the
tree works as a Hash and an Array at the same time!

This font will assist people who are learning kanji, and will help teachers of
Japanese in the preparation of classroom material.
In the parts of your document where you want the kanji to be annotated with
stroke order numbers simply set your document s font to KanjiStrokeOrders.
You will need to set the size of the font to be large to allow the stroke
order numbers to show up 100pt seems to be the minimum usable size.

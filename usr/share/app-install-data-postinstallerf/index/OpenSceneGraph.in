The OpenSceneGraph is an OpenSource, cross platform graphics toolkit for the
development of high performance graphics applications such as flight
simulators, games, virtual reality and scientific visualization.
Based around the concept of a SceneGraph, it provides an object oriented
framework on top of OpenGL freeing the developer from implementing and
optimizing low level graphics calls, and provides many additional utilities
for rapid development of graphics applications.

AICategorizer is a framework for automatic text categorization. It
consists of a collection of Perl modules that implement common
categorization tasks, and a set of defined relationships among those
modules. The various details are flexible - for example, you can choose
what categorization algorithm to use, what features (words or otherwise) of
the documents should be used (or how to automatically choose these
features), what format the documents are in, and so on.

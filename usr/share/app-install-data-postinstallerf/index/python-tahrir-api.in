API for interacting with the Tahrir database Based on the `Tahrir
<https//github.com/fedora-infra/tahrir>`_ database model.

There are two classes that can be used in this module. The first is
TahrirDatabase class located in tahrir_api.dbapi and the second is the database
model located in tahrir_api.model. The TahrirDatabase class is a high level way
to interact with the database. The model is used for a slightly more low level
way of interacting with the database. It allows for custom interactions with
the database without having to use the TahrirDatabase class.

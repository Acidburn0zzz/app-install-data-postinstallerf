Dvipdfmx (formerly dvipdfm-cjk) is a development of dvipdfm
created to support multi-byte character encodings and large
character sets for East Asian languages. Dvipdfmx, if "called"
with the name dvipdfm, operates in a "dvipdfm compatibility"
mode, so that users of the both packages need only keep one
executable. A secondary design goal is to support as many "PDF"
features as does pdfTeX. There being no documentation as such,
users are advised to consult the documentation of dvipdfm (as
well, of course, as the package Readme.

A collection of Concurrent and Highly Scalable Utilities. These
are intended as direct replacements for the java.util.* or
java.util.concurrent.* collections but with better performance
when many CPUs are using the collection concurrently.

This package contains a Mavenized fork of http//high-scale-lib.sourceforge.net/

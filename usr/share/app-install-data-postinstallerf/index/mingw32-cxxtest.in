Comment3='
CxxTest is a JUnit/CppUnit/xUnit-like framework for C++.
Its advantages over existing alternatives are that it
 - doesnt require RTTI
 - doesnt require member template functions
 - doesnt require exception handling
 - doesnt require any external libraries (including memory management,
   file/console I/O, graphics libraries)

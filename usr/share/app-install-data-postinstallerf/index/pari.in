PARI is a widely used computer algebra system designed for fast computations in
number theory (factorizations, algebraic number theory, elliptic curves...),
but also contains a large number of other useful functions to compute with
mathematical entities such as matrices, polynomials, power series, algebraic
numbers, etc., and a lot of transcendental functions.

This package contains the shared libraries. The interactive
calculator PARI/GP is in package pari-gp.

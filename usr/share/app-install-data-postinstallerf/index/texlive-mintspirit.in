Comment3='
The package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
support for the MintSpirit and MintSpiritNo2 families of fonts,
designed by Hirwen Harendal. MintSpirit was originally designed
for use as a system font on a Linux Mint system. The No. 2
variant provides more conventional shapes for some glyphs.

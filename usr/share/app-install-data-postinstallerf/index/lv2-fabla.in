lv2-fabla is a drum sampler plugin instrument. It is ideal for loading up your
favorite sampled sounds and bashing away on a MIDI controller. Or if it?s
crafty beat programming your after that?s cool too! The ADSR envelope allows
the shaping of hi-hats and kicks while the compressor beefs up the sound for
those thumping kicks!

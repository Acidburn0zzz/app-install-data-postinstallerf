herbstluftwm is a manual tiling window manager for X11 using Xlib and Glib.
Its main features can be described with

- The layout is based on splitting frames into subframes which can be split
again or can be filled with windows;
- Tags (or workspaces or virtual desktops or ?) can be added/removed at
runtime. Each tag contains an own layout exactly one tag is viewed on each
monitor. The tags are monitor independent;
- It is configured at runtime via ipc calls from herbstclient. So the
configuration file is just a script which is run on startup.

Comment3='
For those of us that prefer the Ruby programming language above all
others, the XChat-Ruby Plugin now allows X-Chat plugins to be written
in Ruby, in addition to the other supported scripting interfaces. This
means that, for the first time, you can use a purely object-oriented
language in which to write X-Chat plugins.

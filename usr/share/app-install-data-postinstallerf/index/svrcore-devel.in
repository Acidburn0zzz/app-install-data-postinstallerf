Comment3='
svrcore provides applications with several ways to handle secure PIN storage
e.g. in an application that must be restarted, but needs the PIN to unlock
the private key and other crypto material, without user intervention.  svrcore
uses the facilities provided by NSS.

This package contains header files and symlinks to develop programs which will
use the libsvrcore library.  You should install this package if you need to
develop programs which will use the svrcore library.

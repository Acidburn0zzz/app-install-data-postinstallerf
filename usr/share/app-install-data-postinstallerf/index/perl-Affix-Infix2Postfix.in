Comment3='
Infix2Postfix as the name suggests converts from infix to postfix notation.
The reason why someone would like to do this is that postfix notation is
generally much easier to do in computers. For example take an expression
like a+b+c*d. For us humans its pretty easy to do that calculation. But
its actually much better for computers to get a string of operations such
as a b + c d * +, where the variable names mean put variable on stack.

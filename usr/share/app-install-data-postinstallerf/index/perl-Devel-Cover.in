Comment3='
This module provides code coverage metrics for Perl. Code coverage metrics
describe how thoroughly tests exercise code. By using DevelCover you can
discover areas of code not exercised by your tests and determine which
tests to create to increase coverage. Code coverage can be considered as an
indirect measure of quality.

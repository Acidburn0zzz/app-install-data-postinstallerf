Comment3='
This module is used to read HTTP headers from a string and to parse them
into an internal storage format for easy access and modification. You can
also ask the module to reconstitute the headers into one big string, useful
if youre writing a proxy and need to read and write headers while
maintaining the ability to modify individual parts of the whole.

GNU Pem, is a personal expenses manager. Pem lets keep track of
personal income and expense in an extremely elegant manner.
On Linux like systems, Pem works by storing the details in
a CSV file, placed in the  ~/.pem directory under your $HOME
directory; On Windows, the same file is placed in pem directory,
under the USERPROFILE directory. Each such file is named after
the current month, and is automatically created by Pem when you
enter the first record  for the month. It is not advisable to
edit these files by hand.

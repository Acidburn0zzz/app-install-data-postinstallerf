Comment3='
Thin is a Ruby web server that glues together three of the best Ruby
libraries in web history.
The Mongrel parser, the root of Mongrel speed and security,
Event Machine, a network I/O library with extremely high scalability and
Rack, a minimal interface between webservers and Ruby frameworks.

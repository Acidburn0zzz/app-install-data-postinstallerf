Comment3='
This module adds an additional target to the Makefile generated by
ExtUtilsMakeMaker. The target, testcover, calls cover, the
command-line script to generate test coverage statistics, to clean up
any data from a previous run. It then runs the tests, as if make test
was run, then calls cover again to generate the coverage statistics.

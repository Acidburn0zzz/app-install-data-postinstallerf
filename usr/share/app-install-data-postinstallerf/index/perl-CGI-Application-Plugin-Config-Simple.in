Comment3='
This module acts as a plugin for ConfigSimple to be easily used inside of
a CGIApplication module. It does not provide every method available from
ConfigSimple but rather easy access to your configuration variables. It
does however provide direct access to the underlying ConfigGeneral object
created if you want to use its full power.

repo_manager allows you to easily manage your RPM repositories. It helps
you add or remove RPMs from your repositories, it allows you to upgrade a
RPM from one repo into another one (for example from testing to prod).
Repo_manager can also give you some information about the state of your
repositories (number of RPMs, SRPMs, duplicates) and clean them (ie remove
the duplicates while keeping the last X versions available, X being set by
the user).

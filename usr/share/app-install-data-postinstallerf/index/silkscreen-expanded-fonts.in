Silkscreen is a four member type family for your Web graphics created by Jason
Kottke. Silkscreen is best used in places where extremely small graphical
display type is needed. The primary use is for navigational items (nav bars,
menus, etc), but it works well wherever small type is needed. In order to
preserve the proper spacing and letterforms, Silkscreen should be used at 8pt.
multiples (8pt., 16pt., 24pt., etc.) with anti-aliasing turned off.
This font family has a slightly expanded spacing between the letters in
comparison to the normal Silkscreen font family.

SSH (Secure SHell) is a program for logging into and executing
commands on a remote machine. SSH is intended to replace rlogin and
rsh, and to provide secure encrypted communications between two
untrusted hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and
arbitrary TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

OpenSSH is OpenBSDs version of the last free version of SSH, bringing
it up to date in terms of security and features.
This version of OpenSSH has been modified to support GSI authentication.

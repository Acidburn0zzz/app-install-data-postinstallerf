KSudoku is a logic-based symbol placement puzzle.  The player has to
fill a grid with symbols so that each column, row and block on the game
board contains only one instance of each symbol. In KSudoku the symbols
are usually the numbers 1 to 9, but may be the letters A to P or A to
Y in larger puzzles. Puzzles start with the board partially filled and
it is your job to fill in the rest.

NorduGrid is a collaboration aiming at development, maintenance and
support of the free Grid middleware, known as the Advanced Resource
Connector (ARC).

ARC plugins for GFAL2. This allows third-party transfer and adds support
for several extra transfer protocols (rfio, dcap, gsidcap). Specific
protocol support is provided by separate gfal2-plugin packages.

Comment3='
XMLXerces is the Perl API to the Apache projects Xerces XML parser. It is
implemented using the Xerces C++ API, and it provides access to most of the C++
API from Perl.
Because it is based on Xerces-C, XMLXerces provides a validating XML parser
that makes it easy to give your application the ability to read and write XML
data. Classes are provided for parsing, generating, manipulating, and
validating XML documents. XMLXerces is faithful to the XML 1.0 recommendation
and associated standards (DOM levels 1, 2, and 3, SAX 1 and 2, Namespaces, and
W3C XML Schema). The parser provides high performance, modularity, and
scalability, and provides full support for Unicode.

The suds project is a python soap web services client lib.  Suds leverages
python meta programming to provide an intuitive API for consuming web
services.  Objectification of types defined in the WSDL is provided
without class generation.  Programmers rarely need to read the WSDL since
services and WSDL based objects can be easily inspected.

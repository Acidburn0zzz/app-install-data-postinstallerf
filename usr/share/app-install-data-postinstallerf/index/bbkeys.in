Comment3='
bbkeys is a configurable key-grabber designed for the blackbox window manager
which is written by Brad Hughes.  It is based on the bbtools object code
created by John Kennis and re-uses some of the blackbox window manager classes
as well.  bbkeys is easily configurable via directly hand-editing the users
~/.bbkeysrc file, or by using the GUI total blackbox configurator, bbconf.

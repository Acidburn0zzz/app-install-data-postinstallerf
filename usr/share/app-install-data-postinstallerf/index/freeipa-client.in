IPA is an integrated solution to provide centrally managed Identity (machine,
user, virtual machines, groups, authentication credentials), Policy
(configuration settings, access control information) and Audit (events,
logs, analysis thereof). If your network uses IPA for authentication,
this package should be installed on every client machine.

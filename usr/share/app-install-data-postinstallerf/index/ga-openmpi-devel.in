The Global Arrays (GA) toolkit provides an efficient and portable
"shared-memory" programming interface for distributed-memory
computers. Each process in a MIMD parallel program can asynchronously
access logical blocks of physically distributed dense multi-
dimensional arrays, without need for explicit cooperation by other
processes. Unlike other shared-memory environments, the GA model
exposes to the programmer the non-uniform memory access (NUMA)
characteristics of the high performance computers and acknowledges
that access to a remote portion of the shared data is slower than to

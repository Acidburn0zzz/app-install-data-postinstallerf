NUnit is a unit-testing framework for all .Net languages. Initially
ported from JUnit, the current release, version 2.2, is the fourth
major release of this Unit based unit testing tool for Microsoft .NET.
It is written entirely in C# and  has been completely redesigned to
take advantage of many .NET language features, for example
custom attributes and other reflection related capabilities. NUnit
brings xUnit to all .NET languages.

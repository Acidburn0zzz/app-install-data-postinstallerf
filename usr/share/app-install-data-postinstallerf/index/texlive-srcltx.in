Comment='<span size="xx-large">Jump between DVI and TeX files</span>'
Comment3='
Provides a \special insertion into generated .dvi files
allowing one to jump from the .dvi file to the .tex source and
back again (given a .dvi viewer that supports this, such as Yap
or xdvi version 22.38 or later). This was originally written by
Aleksander Simonic, the author of the WinEdt shell.

The functions for creating temporary files and directories in the base library
are quite limited. The unixutils package contains some good ones,
but they arent portable to Windows. This library repackages the
Cabal implementations of its own temporary file and folder functions
so that you can use them without linking against Cabal or depending on
it being installed.

Comment3='
This is a library for handling page faults in user mode. A page fault
occurs when a program tries to access to a region of memory that is
currently not available. Catching and handling a page fault is a useful
technique for implementing
  - pageable virtual memory
  - memory-mapped access to persistent databases
  - generational garbage collectors
  - stack overflow handlers
  - distributed shared memory

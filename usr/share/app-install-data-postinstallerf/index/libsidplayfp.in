This library provides support for playing SID music modules originally
created on Commodore 64 and compatibles. It contains a processing engine
for MOS 6510 machine code and MOS 6581 Sound Interface Device (SID)
chip output. It is used by music player programs like SIDPLAY and
several plug-ins for versatile audio players.

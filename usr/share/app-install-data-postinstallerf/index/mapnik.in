Mapnik is a Free Toolkit for developing mapping applications.
Its written in C++ and there are Python bindings to
facilitate fast-paced agile development. It can comfortably
be used for both desktop and web development, which was something
I wanted from the beginning.

Mapnik is about making beautiful maps. It uses the AGG library
and offers world class anti-aliasing rendering with subpixel
accuracy for geographic data. It is written from scratch in
modern C++ and doesnt suffer from design decisions made a decade

The OpenVAS Manager is the central service that consolidates plain vulnerability
scanning into a full vulnerability management solution. The Manager controls the
Scanner via OTP and itself offers the XML-based, stateless OpenVAS Management
Protocol (OMP). All intelligence is implemented in the Manager so that it is
possible to implement various lean clients that will behave consistently e.g.
with regard to filtering or sorting scan results. The Manager also controls
a SQL database (sqlite-based) where all configuration and scan result data is
centrally stored.

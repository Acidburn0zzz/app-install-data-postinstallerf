Comment3='
This library provides a driver for Hokuyo laser scanner devices using the
SCIP protocol version 1 or 2. It has been tested with the Hokuyo URG-04LX,
UBG-04LX, UHG-08LX, UTM-30LX and UXM-30LX-E but it should work with any
scanner that conforms to these protocol versions, including the URG-04LX-F01
and the URG-04LX-UG01 (Simple-URG).

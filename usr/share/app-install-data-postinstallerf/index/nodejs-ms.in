This module is a tiny milliseconds conversion utility for Node.js.

It does the following
 - If a number is supplied to ms, a string with a unit is returned.
 - If a string that contains the number is supplied, it returns it as a
   number (e.g it returns 100 for 100).
 - If you pass a string with a number and a valid unit, the number of
   equivalent milliseconds is returned.

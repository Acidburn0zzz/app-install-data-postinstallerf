Pure-FTPd is a fast, production-quality, standard-comformant FTP server,
based upon Troll-FTPd. Unlike other popular FTP servers, it has no known
security flaw, it is really trivial to set up and it is especially designed
for modern Linux and FreeBSD kernels (setfsuid, sendfile, capabilities) .
Features include PAM support, IPv6, chroot()ed home directories, virtual
domains, built-in LS, anti-warez system, bandwidth throttling, FXP, bounded
ports for passive downloads, UL/DL ratios, native LDAP and SQL support,
Apache log files and more.

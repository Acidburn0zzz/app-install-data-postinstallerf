Configuration is a project to provide a generic Configuration
interface and allow the source of the values to vary. It
provides easy typed access to single, as well as lists of
configuration values based on a key.
Right now you can load properties from a simple properties
file, a properties file in a jar, an XML file, JNDI settings,
as well as use a mix of different sources using a
ConfigurationFactory and CompositeConfiguration.
Custom configuration objects are very easy to create now
by just subclassing AbstractConfiguration. This works

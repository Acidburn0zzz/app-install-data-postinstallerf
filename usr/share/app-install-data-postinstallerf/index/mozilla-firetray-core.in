Comment3='
Firetray is a system tray add on for mozilla, this package contains
the files needed for all mozilla applications to use the Firetray extension.
But it doesnt do anything by itself.

If you want to enable firetray functionality for a mozilla application,
install the corresponding package; for example, if you want to enable
it for Thunderbird, install mozilla-firetray-thunderbird package.

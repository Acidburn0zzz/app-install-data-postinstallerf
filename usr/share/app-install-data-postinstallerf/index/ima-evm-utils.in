The Trusted Computing Group(TCG) run-time Integrity Measurement Architecture
(IMA) maintains a list of hash values of executables and other sensitive
system files, as they are read or executed. These are stored in the file
systems extended attributes. The Extended Verification Module (EVM) prevents
unauthorized changes to these extended attributes on the file system.
ima-evm-utils is used to prepare the file system for these extended attributes.

PortAudio is a portable audio I/O library designed for cross-platform
support of audio. It uses a callback mechanism to request audio processing.
Audio can be generated in various formats, including 32 bit floating point,
and will be converted to the native format internally.

This package contains files required to build applications that will use the
portaudio library.

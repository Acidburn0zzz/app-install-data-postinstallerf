SCSI disk parameters are held in mode pages. This utility lists or
changes those parameters. Other SCSI devices (or devices that use the
SCSI command set e.g. some SATA devices) such as CD/DVD and tape
drives may also find parts of sdparm useful. Requires the linux kernel
2.4 series or later. In the 2.6 series any device node the understands
a SCSI command set may be used (e.g. /dev/sda). In the 2.4 series SCSI
device node may be used.

Fetches Vital Product Data pages. Can send commands to start or stop
the media and load or unload removable media.

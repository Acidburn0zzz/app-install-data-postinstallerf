Comment3='
NOCpulse provides application, network, systems and transaction monitoring,
coupled with a comprehensive reporting system including availability,
historical and trending reports in an easy-to-use browser interface.

This package contain an abstract PERL class that tries and fails to cover up
the ugliness that is OO in Perl, amongst other things.

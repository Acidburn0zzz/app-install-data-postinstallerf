A wonderfully simple way to load your code.

Tired of futzing around with require statements everywhere,
littering your code with require File (__FILE__) crap?
What if you could just point something at a big directory full
of code and have everything just auto-magically load regardless
of the dependency structure?
Wouldnt that be nice? Well, now you can!

The lensfun library provides an open source database of photographic lenses and
their characteristics. It not only provides a way to read and search the
database, but also provides a set of algorithms for correcting images based on
detailed knowledge of lens properties. Right now lensfun is designed to correct
distortion, transversal (also known as lateral) chromatic aberrations,
vignetting and color contribution of a lens.

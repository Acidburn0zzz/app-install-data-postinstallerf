Computes the conductor and reduction types for a genus 2 hyperelliptic
curve.

As an example of genus2reductions functionality, let C be a proper
smooth curve of genus 2 defined by a hyperelliptic equation
y^2+Q(x)y=P(x), where P(x) and Q(x) are polynomials with rational
coefficients such that deg(Q(x))<4, deg(P(x))<7.  Let J(C) be the
Jacobian of C, let X be the minimal regular model of C over the ring of
integers Z.

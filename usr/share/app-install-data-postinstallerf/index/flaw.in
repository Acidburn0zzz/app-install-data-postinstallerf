FLAW is a free top-down wizard battle game.
It can be played by up to 5 players simultaneously. The goal of the game is to
survive as long as possible while more and more fireballs appear in the arena.
Game play is simple and self-explanatory. Its all about evading the fireballs
and knocking your opponents down. In addition there are collectible magic gems
that provide special abilities.

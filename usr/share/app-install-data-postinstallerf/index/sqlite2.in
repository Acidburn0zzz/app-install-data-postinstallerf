SQLite is a small, fast, embeddable SQL database engine that supports
most of SQL92, including transactions with atomic commit and rollback,
subqueries, compound queries, triggers, and views. A complete database
is stored in a single cross-platform disk file. The native C/C++ API
is simple and easy to use. Bindings for other languages are also
available.

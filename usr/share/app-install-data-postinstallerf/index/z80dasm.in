Comment3='
z80dasm is a disassembler for the Zilog Z80 microprocessor and
compatibles. It can be used to reverse engineer programs and operating
systems for 1980s microcomputers using this processor architecture
(for example ZX81, Spectrum, Galaksija and many others).  Generated
assembly code can be assembled back with a number of Z80
assemblers. Compatibility with z80asm was thoroughly tested.

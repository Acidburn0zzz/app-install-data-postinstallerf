SysBench is a modular, cross-platform and multi-threaded benchmark
tool for evaluating OS parameters that are important for a system
running a database under intensive load.

The idea of this benchmark suite is to quickly get an impression about
system performance without setting up complex database benchmarks or
even without installing a database at all. Current features allow to
test the following system parameters
- file I/O performance
- scheduler performance

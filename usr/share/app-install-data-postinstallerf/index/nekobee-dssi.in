Since it was first released in 2004, the Disposable Soft Synth Interface has
allowed Linux audio users to have simple plugin software synthesizers. Over
time, the number of these has grown as users and coders have developed new
plugins for particular sounds. Now, nekosynth brings some new plugins to enrich
your sonic palette.

This package provides the nekobee DSSI plugin, which is suitable for recreating
those squelchy acid sounds.

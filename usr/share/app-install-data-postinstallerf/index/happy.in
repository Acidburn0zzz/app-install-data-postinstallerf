Happy is a LALR(1) parser generator system for Haskell, similar to the tool
`yacc for C. Like `yacc, it takes a file containing an annotated BNF
specification of a grammar and produces a Haskell module containing a
parser for the grammar.

Happy is flexible you can have several Happy parsers in the same
program, and several entry points to a single grammar. Happy can work
in conjunction with a lexical analyser supplied by the user (either
hand-written or generated by another program).

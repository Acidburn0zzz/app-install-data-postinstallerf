Comment3='
This module implements automatic offsetting of string indices. In normal
Perl, the first character of a string has index 0, the second character has
index 1, and so on. This module allows string indexes to start at some
other value. Most commonly it is used to give the first character of a
string the index 1 (and the second 2, and so on), to imitate the indexing
behavior of FORTRAN and many other languages. It is usually considered
poor style to do this.

This library was designed to make it easier to access web services that
claim to be "RESTful". A RESTful service should have urls that represent
remote objects, which methods can then be called on. The majority of services
dont actually adhere to this strict definition. Instead, their RESTful end
point usually has an API that is just simpler to use compared to other types
of APIs they may support (XML-RPC, for instance). It is this kind of API that
this library is attempting to support.

DataDumper and other modules do a great job of dumping data structures.
Their output, however, often takes more brain power to understand than the
data itself.  When dumping large amounts of data, the output can be
overwhelming and it can be difficult to see the relationship between each
piece of the dumped data.

DataTreeDumper also dumps data in a tree-like fashion but hopefully in a
format more easily understood.

The Virtual Organization Membership Service (VOMS) is an attribute authority
which serves as central repository for VO user authorization information,
providing support for sorting users into group hierarchies, keeping track of
their roles and other attributes in order to issue trusted attribute
certificates and SAML assertions used in the Grid environment for
authorization purposes.

This package provides a java client API for VOMS.

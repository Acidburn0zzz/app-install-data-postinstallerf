Variety changes the desktop wallpaper on a regular basis,
using user-specified or automatically downloaded images.

Variety sits conveniently as an indicator in the panel
and can be easily paused and resumed. The mouse wheel
can be used to scroll wallpapers back and forth until
you find the perfect one for your current mood.
Apart from displaying images from local folders, several
different online sources can be used to fetch wallpapers

Comment3='
This module attempts to provide a small, fast utility for working with file
paths. It is friendlier to use than FileSpec and provides easy access to
functions from several other core file handling modules.

It doesnt attempt to be as full-featured as IOAll or PathClass, nor does
it try to work for anything except Unix-like and Win32 platforms. Even then, it
might break if you try something particularly obscure or tortuous.
All paths are forced to have Unix-style forward slashes. Stringifying the
object gives you back the path (after some clean up).

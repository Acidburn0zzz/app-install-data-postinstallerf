Neutron is a virtual network service for Openstack. Just like
OpenStack Nova provides an API to dynamically request and configure
virtual servers, Neutron provides an API to dynamically request and
configure virtual networks. These networks connect "interfaces" from
other OpenStack services (e.g., virtual NICs from Nova VMs). The
Neutron API supports extensions to provide advanced network
capabilities (e.g., QoS, ACLs, network monitoring, etc.)

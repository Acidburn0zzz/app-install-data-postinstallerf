Comment3='
The DevelDProf package is a Perl code profiler. This will collect
information on the execution time of a Perl script and of the subs in that
script. This information can be used to determine which subroutines are
using the most time and which subroutines are being called most often. This
information can also be used to create an execution graph of the script,
showing subroutine relationships.

This module is deprecated and new users are advised to use DevelNYTProf
instead.

Control X from the command line for scripts, and do "visual
scraping" to find things on the screen. The control interface allows
mouse movement, clicking, button up/down, key up/down, etc, and uses
the XTest extension so you dont have the annoying problems that xse
has when apps ignore sent events. The visgrep program find images
inside of images and reports the coordinates, allowing programs to
find buttons, etc, on the screen to click on.

This package allows tests to be run and results automatically aggregated and
output to STDOUT.

Although, for historical reasons, the Test-Harness distribution takes its name
from this module it now exists only to provide TAPHarness with an interface
that is somewhat backwards compatible with TestHarness 2.xx. If youre
writing new code consider using TAPHarness directly instead.

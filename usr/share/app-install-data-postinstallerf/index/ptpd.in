Comment3='
The PTP daemon (PTPd) implements the Precision Time protocol (PTP) as defined
by the relevant IEEE 1588 standard. PTP was developed to provide very precise
time coordination of LAN connected computers.

PTPd is a complete implementation of the IEEE 1588 specification for a standard
(non-boundary) clock. PTPd has been tested with and is known to work properly
with other IEEE 1588 implementations.
PTPd can run on most 32-bit or 64-bit, little- or big-endian processors. It
does not require an FPU, so it is great for embedded processors.

Comment3='
NetWorkSpaces (NWS) is a powerful, open-source software package that makes it
easy to use clusters from within scripting languages like Python, R, and
Matlab. It uses a Space-based approach that makes it easier to write
distributed applications. NWS looks and feels like a conventional workspace
in the base scripting language, enables network script processes to share
data, provides general distributed/parallel script execution, runs network
script processes either uncoupled or coordinated, and dramatically increases
developer productivity in implementing and maintaining distributed
applications because of its anonymous communication.

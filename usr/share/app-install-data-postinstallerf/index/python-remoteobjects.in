remoteobjects are real subclassable Python objects on which you can build a
rich API library.

remoteobjects provides easy coding and transfer between Python objects and a
JSON REST API. You can define the resources in a RESTful API as RemoteObject
classes and their properties. These objects then support using the basic HTTP
verbs to request and submit data to the API.

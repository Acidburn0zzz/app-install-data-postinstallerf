django-celery provides Celery integration for Django; Using the Django ORM and
cache backend for storing results, autodiscovery of task modules for
applications listed in INSTALLED_APPS, and more.

Celery is a task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing. It is
focused on real-time operation, but supports scheduling as well.
The execution units, called tasks, are executed concurrently on a single or more
worker servers. Tasks can execute asynchronously (in the background) or
synchronously (wait until ready).

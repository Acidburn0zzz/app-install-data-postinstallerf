Comment3='
The JGoodies Animation framework enables you to produce time-based real-time
animations in Java. It uses concepts and notions as described by the W3C
specification for the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL).

This animation framework has been designed for a seemless, flexible
and powerful integration with Java, ease-of-use and a small library size.
Unlike SMIL we use Java to describe the animations ? not XML.

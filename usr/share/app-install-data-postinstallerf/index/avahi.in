Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on
computer into a network and instantly be able to view other people who
you can chat with, find printers to print to or find files being
shared. This kind of technology is already found in MacOS X (branded
Rendezvous, Bonjour and sometimes ZeroConf) and is very
convenient.

The Content Construction Kit allows you to add custom fields to custom
content types using a web interface. In Drupal 5.x, custom content types
can be created in Drupal core, and the Content Construction Kit allows
you to add custom fields to any content type. In Drupal 7 and later,
most of the functionality of CCK has been absorbed into Drupal core.

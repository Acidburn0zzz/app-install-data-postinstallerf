The Tiresias family of fonts has been designed for use in multiple environments
to help improve legibility, especially for individuals with visual impairment.
It includes specialized fonts for information labels, control labels (for key
tops), large print publications, computer systems, television subtitling, and
signs.
This package consists of files used by other Tiresias packages.

CellWriter is a grid-entry natural handwriting input panel. As
you write characters into the cells, your writing is instantly
recognized at the character level. When you press Enter on the
panel, the input you entered is sent to the currently focused
application as if typed on the keyboard.

Works well on a Wacom tablet, TabletPC, or any device with a stylus.

Female Castillian-Spanish (es_ES) voice ?SFL? for Festival.

This is a diphone-based male Spanish voice for the Festival speech synthesis
system. These original audio files were recorded by a professional voice
talent in a recording studio.
This voice was developed by the Consejeria de Innovacion, Ciencia y Empresa
of the Junta de Andalucia on a project awarded to MP Sistemas in
collaboration with Intelligent Dialogue Systems (INDISYS).

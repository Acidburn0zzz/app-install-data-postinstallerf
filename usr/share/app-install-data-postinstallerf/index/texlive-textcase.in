The textcase package offers commands \MakeTextUppercase and
\MakeTextLowercase are similar to the standard \MakeUppercase
and \MakeLowercase, but they do not change the case of any
sections of mathematics, or the arguments of \cite, \label and
\ref commands within the argument. A further command
\NoCaseChange does nothing but suppress case change within its
argument, so to force uppercase of a section including an
environment, one might say
\MakeTextUppercase{...\NoCaseChange{\begin{foo}}
...\NoCaseChange{\end{foo}}...}

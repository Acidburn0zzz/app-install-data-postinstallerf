projectM is an awesome music visualizer. There is nothing better in the world
of Unix. projectMs greatness comes from the hard work of the community. Users
like you can create presets that connect music with incredible visuals.
projectM is an LGPLed reimplementation of Milkdrop under OpenGL. All projectM
requires is a video card with 3D acceleration and your favorite music.

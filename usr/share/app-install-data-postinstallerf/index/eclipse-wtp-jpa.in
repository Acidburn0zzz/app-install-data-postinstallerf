Comment3='
The Dali Java Persistence Tools Project provides extensible frameworks and
tools for the definition and editing of Object-Relational (O/R) mappings for
Java Persistence API (JPA) entities. JPA mapping support focuses on minimizing
the complexity of mapping by providing entity generation wizards, design-time
validation, and a rich UI for entity and persistence unit configuration.

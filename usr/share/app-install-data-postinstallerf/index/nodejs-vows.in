Vows is an asynchronous behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for
Node.js.

Vows was built from the ground up to test asynchronous code. It
executes your tests in parallel when it makes sense, and sequentially
when there are dependencies. Emphasis was put on speed of execution,
clarity and user experience.

Comment3='
This package contains the virus-database needed by clamav. This
database should be updated regularly; the clamav-update package
ships a corresponding cron-job. This package and the
clamav-data-empty package are mutually exclusive.

Use -data when you want a working (but perhaps outdated) virus scanner
immediately after package installation.
Use -data-empty when you are updating the virus database regulary and
do not want to download a >5MB sized rpm-package with outdated virus

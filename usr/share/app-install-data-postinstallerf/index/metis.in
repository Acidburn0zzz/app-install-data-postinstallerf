Comment3='
METIS is a set of serial programs for partitioning graphs,
partitioning finite element meshes, and producing fill reducing
orderings for sparse matrices.
The algorithms implemented in METIS are based on the multilevel
recursive-bisection, multilevel k-way, and multi-constraint
partitioning schemes developed in our lab.

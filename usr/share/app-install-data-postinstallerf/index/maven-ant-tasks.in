Maven Ant Tasks allow several of Mavens artifact handling features to be
used from within an Ant build. These include

* Dependency management - including transitive dependencies, scope recognition
  and SNAPSHOT handling
* Artifact deployment - deployment to a Maven repository (file integrated,
  other with extensions)
* POM processing - for reading and writing a Maven 2 pom.xml file

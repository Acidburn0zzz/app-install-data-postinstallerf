The Log framework provides an abstracted logging system.
It supports logging to console, file, syslog, SQL, Sqlite, mail, and mcal
targets.  It also provides a subject - observer mechanism.

php-pear-Log can optionally use package "php-pear-DB" (version >= 1.3)
and "php-pear-MDB2" (version >= 2.0.0RC1).

Comment3='
The package provides a way to draw "ribbon proofs" in LaTeX. A
ribbon proof is a diagrammatic representation of a mathematical
proof that a computer program meets its specification. These
diagrams are more human-readable, more scalable, and more
easily modified than the corresponding textual proofs.

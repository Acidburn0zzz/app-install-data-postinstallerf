Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and
evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays
efficiently.  Theano features
- tight integration with NumPy Use numpy.ndarray in Theano-compiled
  functions.
- transparent use of a GPU Perform data-intensive calculations up to
  140x faster than with CPU.(float32 only)
- efficient symbolic differentiation Theano does your derivatives for
  function with one or many inputs.
- speed and stability optimizations Get the right answer for log(1+x)

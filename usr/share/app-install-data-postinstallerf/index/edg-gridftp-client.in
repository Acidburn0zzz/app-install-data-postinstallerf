The edg-gridftp-client package is a thin command line interface on top
of the GridFTP libraries supplied by Globus.  They do, however,
represent a useful set of commands to do basic management of files on
a GridFTP server.

The commands provided are
  edg-gridftp-exists   test if a file/directory exists on the server
  edg-gridftp-mkdir    create a directory on the server
  edg-gridftp-rmdir    remove a directory from a server

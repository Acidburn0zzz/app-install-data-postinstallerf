Expect is a tcl application for automating and testing
interactive applications such as telnet, ftp, passwd, fsck,
rlogin, tip, etc. Expect makes it easy for a script to
control another program and interact with it.

This package originally contained expectk and some scripts
that used it. As expectk was removed from upstream tarball
in expect-5.45, now the package contains just these scripts.
Please use tclsh with package require Tk and Expect instead
of expectk.

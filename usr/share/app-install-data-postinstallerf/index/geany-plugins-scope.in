Scope is a graphical GDB front-end with the normal functions you would
expect (stepping, breakpoints...), and a few notable features

* The communication between Scope and GDB is asynchronous
* You can enter any GDB command, at any time
  (of course, for the command to be executed, GDB must be[come] available)
* All GDB I/O (along with some other messages) is displayed in a terminal-like
  "Debug Console". Whenever you find the GUI lacking, simply switch to that
  console and work directly with GDB
* 7-bit/Locale/UTF-8 support for values.

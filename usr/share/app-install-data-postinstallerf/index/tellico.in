Tellico is a collection manager for KDE. It includes default collections for
books, bibliographies, comic books, videos, music, coins, stamps, trading
cards, and wines, and also allows custom collections. Unlimited user-defined
fields are allowed. Filters are available to limit the visible entries by
definable criteria. Full customization for printing is possible through
editing the default XSLT file. It can import CSV, Bibtex, and Bibtexml and
export CSV, HTML, Bibtex, Bibtexml, and PilotDB. Entries may be imported
directly from Amazon.com.

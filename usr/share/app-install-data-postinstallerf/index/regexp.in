Regexp is a 100% Pure Java Regular Expression package that was
graciously donated to the Apache Software Foundation by Jonathan Locke.
He originally wrote this software back in 1996 and it has stood up quite
well to the test of time.
It includes complete Javadoc documentation as well as a simple Applet
for visual debugging and testing suite for compatibility.

The php-mapi package contains the PHP MAPI extension to provide access to
Microsoft MAPI functions while using PHP. Although not all MAPI functions
and interfaces are supported so far, most functions have a PHP counterpart
in this extension. Using this PHP MAPI extension, developers can create
e.g. webbased e-mail and calendaring systems and interfaces with existing
PHP projects, using the MAPI functions like a normal MAPI program.

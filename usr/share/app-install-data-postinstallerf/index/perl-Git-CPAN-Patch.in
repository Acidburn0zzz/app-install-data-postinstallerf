GitCPANPatch provides a suite of git commands aimed at making trivially
easy the process of grabbing any distribution off CPAN, stuffing it in a
local git repository and, once gleeful hacking has been perpetrated,
sending back patches to its maintainer.

This package provides the backend Perl modules required.  For the git
commands, etc, please install the git-cpan-patch package.

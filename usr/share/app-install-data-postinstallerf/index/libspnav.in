Comment3='
The spacenav project provides a free, compatible alternative to the proprietary
3Dconnexion device driver and SDK, for their 3D input devices (called "space
navigator", "space pilot", "space traveller", etc).

This package provides the library needed for applications to connect to the
user land daemon.

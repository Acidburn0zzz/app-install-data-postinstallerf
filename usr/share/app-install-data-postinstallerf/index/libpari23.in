PARI is a widely used computer algebra system designed for fast computations in
number theory (factorizations, algebraic number theory, elliptic curves...),
but also contains a large number of other useful functions to compute with
mathematical entities such as matrices, polynomials, power series, algebraic
numbers, etc., and a lot of transcendental functions.

This is an old version of the library, for compatibility with applications and
library bindings that have not been migrated to the current stable release.

Comment3='

This library provides a robust and significantly extended implementation of
JSONPath for Python, with a clear AST for meta-programming. It is tested with
Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, and PyPy.
This library differs from other JSONPath implementations in that it is a full
language implementation, meaning the JSONPath expressions are first class
objects, easy to analyze, transform, parse, print, and extend.

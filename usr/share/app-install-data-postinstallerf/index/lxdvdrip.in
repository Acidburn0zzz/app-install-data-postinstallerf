This program is able to rip a DVD title or chapters, reauthor the files to a
DVD-Structure,preview the Files and burn to a DVD+/-R.

The "traditional" way to Rip in 4 Steps (Rip Video&Requant, Rip Audio, Mplex,
dvdauthor) is included, too. Activation through Command Line Parameter
"-st=mplayer" for mplayer or "-st=transcode" for transcode.
A very fast Method is "Transcode parallel", all Commands are piped, so that
only a single Pass Read is needed.

OpenFst is a library for constructing, combining, optimizing, and
searching weighted finite-state transducers (FSTs).  Weighted
finite-state transducers are automata where each transition has an input
label, an output label, and a weight.  The more familiar finite-state
acceptor is represented as a transducer with each transitions input and
output label equal.  Finite-state acceptors are used to represent sets
of strings (specifically, regular or rational sets); finite-state
transducers are used to represent binary relations between pairs of
strings (specifically, rational transductions).  The weights can be used
to represent the cost of taking a particular transition.

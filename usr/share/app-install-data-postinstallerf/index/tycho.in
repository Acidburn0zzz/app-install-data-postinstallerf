Tycho is a set of Maven plugins and extensions for building Eclipse
plugins and OSGI bundles with Maven. Eclipse plugins and OSGI bundles
have their own metadata for expressing dependencies, source folder
locations, etc. that are normally found in a Maven POM. Tycho uses
native metadata for Eclipse plugins and OSGi bundles and uses the POM
to configure and drive the build. Tycho supports bundles, fragments,
features, update site projects and RCP applications. Tycho also knows
how to run JUnit test plugins using OSGi runtime and there is also
support for sharing build results using Maven artifact repositories.

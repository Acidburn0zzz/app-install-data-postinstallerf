JIDE Common Layer is Swing component library built on top of Java/Swing.
It is also the foundation of other component products from JIDE.
This project has over 30 Swing components and over 100k lines of code.
It greatly enhanced the default component set provided by Swing and allow
developers to focus on business logic layer instead of making components.

JIDE Common Layer was originally developed by JIDE Software developers
as a foundation in order to build other more advanced components.
In April of 2007, JIDE Software decided to open source this common layer
so that more and more developers can leverage them instead of wasting time

New is a template system, especially useful in conjunction with a
simple text editor such as vi. The user maintains templates which
may contain format strings. At run time, nf replaces the format
strings in a template with appropriate values to create a new file.
This package provides the libraries, include files, and other
resources needed for developing applications using fmt-ptrns API.

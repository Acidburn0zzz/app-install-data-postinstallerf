p0rn-comfort consists of several support programs for browsing
image-gallery sites.  It includes a proxy which enables blacklisting
of thumbnail sites on-the-fly.  It also supports queueing of entire
pages for download and fetching them at a later time.  Queuing can
either be done manually (directly from your browser) or by an
automated download script which can also follow links between
different galleries.

Comment3='
This module implements the classic Eliza algorithm. The original Eliza
program was written by Joseph Weizenbaum and described in the
Communications of the ACM in 1966. Eliza is a mock Rogerian
psychotherapist. It prompts for user input, and uses a simple
transformation algorithm to change user input into a follow-up question.
The program is designed to give the appearance of understanding.

MMS is a proprietary streaming protocol used in Microsoft server products,
commonly used to stream WMV data.  You can encounter mms// style URLs all over
the net, especially on news sites and other content-serving sites. Libmms
allows you to download content from such sites, making it easy to add MMS
support to your media applications.

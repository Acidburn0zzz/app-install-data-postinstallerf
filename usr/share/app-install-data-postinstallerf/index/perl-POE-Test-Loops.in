POETestLoops contains one function, generate(), which will generate
all the loop tests for one or more POELoop subclasses. The SYNOPSIS
example is a version of poe-gen-tests, which is a stand-alone utility
to generate the actual tests. The poe-gen-tests manual page also documents
the POETestLoops system in more detail.

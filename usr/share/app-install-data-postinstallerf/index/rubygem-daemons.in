Daemons provides an easy way to wrap existing ruby scripts (for example a
self-written server)  to be run as a daemon and to be controlled by simple
start/stop/restart commands.  You can also call blocks as daemons and control
them from the parent or just daemonize the current process.  Besides this
basic functionality, daemons offers many advanced features like exception
backtracing and logging (in case your ruby script crashes) and monitoring and
automatic restarting of your processes if they crash.

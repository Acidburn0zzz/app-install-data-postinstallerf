Joda-Time provides a quality replacement for the Java date and time classes. The
design allows for multiple calendar systems, while still providing a simple API.
The default calendar is the ISO8601 standard which is used by XML. The
Gregorian, Julian, Buddhist, Coptic, Ethiopic and Islamic systems are also
included, and we welcome further additions. Supporting classes include time
zone, duration, format and parsing.

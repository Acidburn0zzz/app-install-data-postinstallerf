The package is provides a PGF/TikZ-based mechanism for drawing
linguistic (and other kinds of) trees. Its main features are -
a packing algorithm which can produce very compact trees; - a
user-friendly interface consisting of the familiar bracket
encoding of trees plus the key-value interface to option-
setting; - many tree-formatting options, with control over
option values of individual nodes and mechanisms for their
manipulation; - the possibility to decorate the tree using the
full power of PGF/TikZ; and - an externalization mechanism
sensitive to code-changes.

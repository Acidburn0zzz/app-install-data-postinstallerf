Comment3='
This plugin was written in response to demand from the users of Acme, GNOME2s
multimedia key manager.  While Acme manages the association of appropriate
keyboard scancodes with the media-control scancodes, it does not know how to
individually control the various media players.  Instead, it arranges the
mapping and expects those media players to listen for the XF86Audio keysyms.

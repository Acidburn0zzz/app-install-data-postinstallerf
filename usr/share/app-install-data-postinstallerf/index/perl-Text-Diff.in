TextDiff provides a basic set of services akin to the GNU diff utility.
It is not anywhere near as feature complete as GNU diff, but it is better
integrated with Perl and available on all platforms. It is often faster
than shelling out to a systems diff executable for small files, and
generally slower on larger files.

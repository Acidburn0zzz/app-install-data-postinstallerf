This package describes a document format for writing GAP documentation.

The idea is to define a sufficiently abstract markup language for GAP
documentation which can be (relatively easily) converted into different
output formats.  We used XML to define such a language.
This package provides
- Utilities to use the documentation which is written in GAPDoc format
  with the GAP help system.  If you dont want to write your own
  (package) documentation you can skip to the last point of this list.

The EC2 Enhanced feature allows for near seamless translation of Condor jobs
in the vanilla universe to condor EC2 jobs in the grid universe.  For all
intents and purposes, the job runs as any vanilla universe job runs except
on an Amazon EC2 AMI instance.

This package provides Condor job router hooks that will translate a job into
a Condor EC2 job and monitor the state of that job.  This should be installed
on condor nodes that will submitting work and wish to use the EC2 Enhanced
feature.

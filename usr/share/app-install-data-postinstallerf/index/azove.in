Azove is a tool designed for counting (without explicit enumeration) and
enumeration of 0/1 vertices.  Given a polytope by a linear relaxation or
facet description P = {x | Ax <= b}, all 0/1 points lying in P can be
counted or enumerated.  This is done by intersecting the polytope P with
the unit-hypercube [0,1] d.  The integral vertices (no fractional ones)
of this intersection will be enumerated.  If P is a 0/1 polytope, azove
solves the vertex enumeration problem.  In fact it can also solve the
0/1 knapsack problem and the 0/1 subset sum problem.

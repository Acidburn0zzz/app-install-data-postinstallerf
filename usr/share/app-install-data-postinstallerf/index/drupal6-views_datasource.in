Views Datasource is a set of plugins for Drupal Views for rendering content in
a number of shareable, reusable formats based on XML, JSON and XHTML. These
formats allow content in a Drupal site to be easily used as data sources for
Semantic Web clients and web mash-ups. Views Datasource plugins output content
from node lists created in the Drupal Views interface in a variety of formats -
XML data documents using schemas like OPML and Atom, RDF data documents using a
vocabulary like FOAF, JSON data documents in a format like Exhibit JSON, and
XHTML data documents using a microformat like hCard.

Views Datasource can be thought of as a userland complement to the work going on

Comment3='
This module provides subs that allow you to read or write entire files with
one simple call. They are designed to be simple to use, have flexible ways
to pass in or get the file contents and to be very efficient. There is also
a sub to read in all the files in a directory other than . and ..

These slurp/spew subs work for files, pipes and sockets, and stdio,
pseudo-files, and DATA.

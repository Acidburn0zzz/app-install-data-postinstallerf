This module installs PAR distributions (i.e. .par files) into any perl
installation on the system. The PARDist module can install into the
currently running perl by default and provides the necessary parameters to
override any installation directories. Figuring out how to use those
overrides in order to install into an arbitrary perl installation on the
system may be beyond most users, however. Hence this convenience wrapper
using ExtUtilsInferConfig to automatically determine the typical site
installation paths of any perl interpreter than can be executed by the
current user.

Nifti2Dicom is a conversion tool that converts 3D NIfTI files (and other
formats supported by ITK, including Analyze, MetaImage Nrrd and VTK)
to DICOM.

Unlike other conversion tools, it can import a DICOM file that is used
to import the patient and study DICOM tags, and allows you to edit the
accession number and other DICOM tags, in order to create a valid DICOM
that can be imported in a PACS.

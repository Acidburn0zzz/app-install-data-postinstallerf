coan (formerly sunifdef) is a software engineering tool for analyzing
pre-processor-based configurations of C or C++ source code. Its principal use
is to simplify a body of source code by eliminating any parts that are
redundant with respect to a specified configuration.

coan is most useful to developers of constantly evolving products
with large code bases, where pre-processor conditionals are used to
configure the feature sets, APIs or implementations of different
releases. In these environments the code base steadily
accumulates #ifdef-pollution as transient configuration options become

Comment3='
Data format extension for Jackson (http//jackson.codehaus.org)
to offer alternative support for serializing POJOs as XML and
deserializing XML as POJOs. Support implemented on top of Stax API
(javax.xml.stream), by implementing core Jackson Streaming API types
like JsonGenerator, JsonParser and JsonFactory. Some data-binding types
overridden as well (ObjectMapper sub-classed as XmlMapper).

JACK is a low-latency audio server, written primarily for the Linux operating
system. It can connect a number of different applications to an audio device, as
well as allowing them to share audio between themselves. Its clients can run in
their own processes (i.e. as a normal application), or can they can run within a
JACK server (i.e. a "plugin").

JACK is different from other audio server efforts in that it has been designed
from the ground up to be suitable for professional audio work. This means that
it focuses on two key areas synchronous execution of all clients, and low
latency operation.

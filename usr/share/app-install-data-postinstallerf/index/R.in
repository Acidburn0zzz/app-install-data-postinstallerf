This is a metapackage that provides both core R userspace and
all R development components.

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
R is similar to the award-winning S system, which was developed at
Bell Laboratories by John Chambers et al. It provides a wide
variety of statistical and graphical techniques (linear and
nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis,
classification, clustering, ...).

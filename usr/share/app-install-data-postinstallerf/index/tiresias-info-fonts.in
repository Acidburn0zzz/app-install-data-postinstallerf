Comment3='

The Tiresias family of fonts has been designed for use in multiple environments
to help improve legibility, especially for individuals with visual impairment.
It includes specialized fonts for information labels, control labels (for key
tops), large print publications, computer systems, television subtitling, and
signs.
The Infofont family is specialized for use in informational labels on public
terminals such as ATMs using large characters. The only	difference between the
Infofont and the Infofont Z families is whether the zero is crossed out or not.

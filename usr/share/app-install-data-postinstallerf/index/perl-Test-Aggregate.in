*WARNING* this is ALPHA code. The interface is not guaranteed to be
stable.

A common problem with many test suites is that they can take a
long time to run. The longer they run, the less likely you are to run
the tests. This module borrows a trick from ApacheRegistry to load
up your tests at once, create a separate package for each test and wraps
each package in a method named run_the_tests. This allows us to load
perl only once and related modules only once. If you have modules which
are expensive to load, this can dramatically speed up a test suite.

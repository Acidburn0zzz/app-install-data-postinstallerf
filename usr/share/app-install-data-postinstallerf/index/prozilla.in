ProZilla is a download accellerator program written for Linux to speed
up the normal file download process. It often gives speed increases of
around 200% to 300%. It supports both FTP and HTTP protocols, and the
theory behind it is very simple.

The program opens multiple connections to a server, and each of the
connections downloads a part of the file, thus defeating existing
internet congestion prevention methods which slow down a single
connection based download.

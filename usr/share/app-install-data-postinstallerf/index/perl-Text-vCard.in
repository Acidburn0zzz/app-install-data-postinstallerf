vCards are electronic business cards used by various message user
agents (MUAs) and defined in RFC 2426.  They are a simple and
extensible representation for common contact information such as
name, company, telephone, fax, address, email, etc. and some
less common information such as IM or Googletalk handles.

This package provides an interface for manipulating vCards.

Actionaz is a task automation tool. It allows you to create and execute action
lists.
You dont need to know any programming language to use it its intuitive
interface allows you to create action lists (scripts) using drag & drop.
Advanced users can use JavaScript (EcmaScript) to extend its functionality.

HEALPix is an acronym for Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization
of a sphere. As suggested in the name, this pixelization produces a
subdivision of a spherical surface in which each pixel covers the same
surface area as every other pixel.

This package contains Fortran binaries and libraries.
NB. Due to some generic names, the binaries have been renamed to start with
hp_, e.g. anafast is now hp_anafast.

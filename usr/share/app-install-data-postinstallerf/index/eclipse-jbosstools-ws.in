JBoss WebServices Tools provides wizards for working with webservices
and a webservice tester view to test out both SOAP and REST services.

JBoss JAX-RS Tools provides a common navigator to browse and introspect
your JAX-RS endpoints and provide validation for JAX-RS annotations, such
as checking that parameters referenced by name actually also are declared.

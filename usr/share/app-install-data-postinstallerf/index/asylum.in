SDL Asylum is a C port of the computer game Asylum, which was written by Andy
Southgate in 1994 for the Acorn Archimedes and is now public domain. The object
is to find things that look like brain cells and shut them down! The game
revolves around shooting anything which moves, collecting anything which
doesnt move and most importantly, finding your way to each of the eight
pulsating neurons scattered through the immense map.

This is an Internet protocol suite Java library originally developed by
ORO, Inc.  This version supports Finger, Whois, TFTP, Telnet, POP3, FTP,
NNTP, SMTP, and some miscellaneous protocols like Time and Echo as well
as BSD R command support. The purpose of the library is to provide
fundamental protocol access, not higher-level abstractions.

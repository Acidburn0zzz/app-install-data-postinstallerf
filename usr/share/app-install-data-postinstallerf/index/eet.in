Eet is a tiny library designed to write an arbitary set of chunks of
data to a file and optionally compress each chunk (very much like a

needed, and it was much simpler to implement this once here.

It also can encode and decode data structures in memory, as well as
image data for saving to eet files or sending across the network to
other machines, or just writing to arbitary files on the system. All
data is encoded in a platform independent way and can be written and

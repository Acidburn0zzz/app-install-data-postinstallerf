ZConfig is a configuration library intended for general use. It supports
a hierarchical schema-driven configuration model that allows a schema to
specify data conversion routines written in Python. ZConfigs model is
very different from the model supported by the ConfigParser module found
in Pythons standard library, and is more suitable to
configuration-intensive applications.

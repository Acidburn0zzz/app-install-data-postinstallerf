jsoup is a Java library for working with real-world HTML.
It provides a very convenient API for extracting and manipulating data,
using the best of DOM, CSS, and jquery-like methods.

jsoup implements the WHATWG HTML5 specification,
and parses HTML to the same DOM as modern browsers do.
 - scrape and parse HTML from a URL, file, or string
 - find and extract data, using DOM traversal or CSS selectors
 - manipulate the HTML elements, attributes, and text

Itsdangerous is a Python library for passing data through untrusted
environments (for example, HTTP cookies) while ensuring the data is not
tampered with.

Internally itsdangerous uses HMAC and SHA1 for signing by default and bases the
implementation on the Django signing module. It also however supports JSON Web
Signatures (JWS).

Comment3='
Ltrace is a debugging program which runs a specified command until the
command exits.  While the command is executing, ltrace intercepts and
records both the dynamic library calls called by the executed process
and the signals received by the executed process.  Ltrace can also
intercept and print system calls executed by the process.

You should install ltrace if you need a sysadmin tool for tracking the
execution of processes.

The BrushScript font simulates hand-written characters; it is
distributed in Adobe Type 1 format (but is available in italic
shape only). The package includes the files needed by LaTeX in
order to use that font. The file AAA_readme.tex fully describes
the package and sample.tex illustrates its use.

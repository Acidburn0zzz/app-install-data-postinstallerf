Accrete is a physical simulation of solar system planet formation,
by modelling a dust cloud around a Sun-like star, injecting a series
of masses which collect dust, and form planets. The simulation then
determines what the planetary environments will be like in terms
of temperature, atmospheric composition, and other factors.

Copas is a dispatcher based on coroutines that can be used by TCP/IP servers.
It uses LuaSocket as the interface with the TCP/IP stack.

A server registered with Copas should provide a handler for requests and use
Copas socket functions to send the response. Copas loops through requests and
invokes the corresponding handlers. For a full implementation of a Copas HTTP
server you can refer to Xavante as an example.

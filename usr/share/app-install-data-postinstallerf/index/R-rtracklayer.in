Extensible framework for interacting with multiple genome browsers (currently
UCSC built-in) and manipulating annotation tracks in various formats
(currently GFF, BED, bedGraph, BED15, WIG, and BigWig built-in). The user may
export/import tracks to/from the supported browsers, as well as query and
modify the browser state, such as the current viewport.

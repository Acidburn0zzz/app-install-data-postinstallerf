The package provides a verbbox environment (which uses
techniques similar to those of the boxedverbatim environment of
the moreverb package) to place its contents into a globally
available box, or into a box specified by the user. The global
box may then be used in a variety of situations (for example,
providing a replica of the boxedverbatim environment itself). A
valuable use is in places where the standard verbatim
environment (which is based on a trivlist) may not appear. The
package makes use of the verbatim package (which is a required
part of any LaTeX distribution).

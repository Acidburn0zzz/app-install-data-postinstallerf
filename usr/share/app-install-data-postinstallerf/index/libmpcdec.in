Musepack is an audio compression format with a strong emphasis on high quality.
Its not lossless, but it is designed for transparency, so that you wont be
able to hear differences between the original wave file and the much smaller
MPC file.
It is based on the MPEG-1 Layer-2 / MP2 algorithms, but has rapidly developed
and vastly improved and is now at an advanced stage in which it contains
heavily optimized and patentless code.

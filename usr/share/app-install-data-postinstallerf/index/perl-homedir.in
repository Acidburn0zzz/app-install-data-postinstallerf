perl-homedir configures the system to automatically create a ~/perl5
directory in each users $HOME on user login.  This allows each user to
install CPAN packages via the CPAN to their $HOME, with no additional
configuration or privileges, and without installing them system-wide.

If you want your users to be able to install and use their own Perl modules,
install this package.

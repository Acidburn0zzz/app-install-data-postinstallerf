The HTTP extension aims to provide a convenient and powerful set of
functionality for major applications.

The HTTP extension eases handling of HTTP URLs, dates, redirects, headers
and messages in a HTTP context (both incoming and outgoing). It also provides
means for client negotiation of preferred language and charset, as well as
a convenient way to exchange arbitrary data with caching and resuming

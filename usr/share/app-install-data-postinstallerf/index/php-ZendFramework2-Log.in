Zend\Log\Logger is a component for general purpose logging. It supports multiple
log backends, formatting messages sent to the log, and filtering messages from
being logged. These functions are divided into the following objects

* A Logger (instance of Zend\Log\Logger) is the object that your application
  uses the most. You can have as many Logger objects as you like; they do not
  interact. A Logger object must contain at least one Writer, and can optionally
  contain one or more Filters.
* A Writer (inherits from Zend\Log\Writer\AbstractWriter) is responsible for
  saving data to storage.

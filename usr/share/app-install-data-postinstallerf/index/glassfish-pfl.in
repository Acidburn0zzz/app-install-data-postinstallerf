The GlassFish MBean Annotation Library (gmbal, pronounced "Gumball")
is a library for using annotations to create Open MBeans. There is similar
functionality in JSR 255 for JDK 7, but gmbal only requires JDK 5. Gmbal
requirements for MBeans. AS a consequence, gmbal-enabled classes
will be fully manageable in GlassFish v3 using the standard GlassFish
v3 admin tools, while still being manageable with generic MBean tools
when not run under GlassFish v3.

This package provides the gmbal Primitive Function Library.

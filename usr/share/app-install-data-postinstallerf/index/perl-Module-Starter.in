This is a CPAN module/utility to assist in the creation of new modules in a
sensible and sane fashion.  Unless youre interested in extending the
functionality of this module, you should examine the documentation for
module-starter, for information on how to use this tool.

It is noted that there are a number of extensions to this tool, including
plugins to create modules using templates as recommended by Damian Conways
"Perl Best Practices" (OReilly, 2005).  (See also the package
perl-Module-Starter-PBP for the aforementioned templates.)

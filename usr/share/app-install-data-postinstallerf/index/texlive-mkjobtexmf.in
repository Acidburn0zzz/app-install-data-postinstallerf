The package provides a Perl script, which runs a program and
tries to find the names of file used. Two methods are
available, option -recorder of (Web2C) TeX and the program
strace. Then it generates a directory with a texmf tree. It
checks the found files and tries sort them in this texmf tree.
The script may be used for archiving purposes or to speed up
later TeX runs.

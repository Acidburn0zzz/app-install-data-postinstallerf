Comment3='
The UNIVERSAL class provides a few default methods so that all objects
can use them. Object orientation allows programmers to override these
methods in subclasses to provide more specific and appropriate behavior.

Some authors call methods in the UNIVERSAL class on potential invocants
as functions, bypassing any possible overriding. This is wrong and you
should not do it. Unfortunately, not everyone heeds this warning and
their bad code can break your good code.

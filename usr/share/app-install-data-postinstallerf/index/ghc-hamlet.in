Hamlet gives you a type-safe tool for generating HTML code.
It works via Quasi-Quoting, and generating extremely
efficient output code. The syntax is white-space sensitive,
and it helps you avoid cross-site scripting issues and 404
errors. Please see the documentation at
<http//www.yesodweb.com/book/shakespearean-templates> for more details.

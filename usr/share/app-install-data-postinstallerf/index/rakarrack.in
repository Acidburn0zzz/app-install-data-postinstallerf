Rakarrack is a basic rack of effects for guitar. 10 effects. Two EQ
(multiband and parametric), distortion, overdrive, echo, chorus,
flanger, phaser, compression and reverb. Real time processing. JACK
support. Online tuner. Bank & Preset management.

Most of the effects are based on the magnificent work done by Paul
Nasca Octavian in ZynAddSubFX synthesizer. The compressor is based on
ArtsCompressor of Matthias Kretzer & Stefen Westerfeld. The tuner was
adapted from tuneit, a tuner in text mode created by Mario Lang. Paul
Nasca is our hero and a continuous inspiration

In Angry, Drunken Dwarves (ADD), you are an angry, drunken dwarf. Why are you
so angry? Who knows. But youve decided to take your aggression out on other
dwarves, by dropping gems on their heads. Lots of gems. ADD is a member of the
classic "falling blocks" puzzle game family, similar to the Capcom game Puzzle
Fighter. The goal of the game is to build large gems by matching up colors,
then break them, raining more gems down onto your opponent. The first person
whose field fills up, loses.

fwbackups is a feature-rich user backup program that allows users (including
but not limited to root) to backup their files on demand or periodically via
backup sets. Each set may have different settings meaning users can backup
groups of files and folders to different destinations at different times.
Restores can be performed at any time using an existing backup from fwbackups
or from the contents of an external folder or archive.

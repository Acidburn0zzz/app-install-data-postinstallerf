This package provides a useful set of utilities for managing cloud images.

The euca2ools package (a dependency of cloud-utils) provides an Amazon EC2 API
compatible set of utilities for bundling kernels, ramdisks, and root
filesystems, and uploading them to either EC2 or UEC.
The tasks associated with image bundling are often tedious and repetitive. The
cloud-utils package provides several scripts that wrap the complicated tasks
with a much simpler interface.

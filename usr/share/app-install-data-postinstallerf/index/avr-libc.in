AVR Libc is a Free Software project whose goal is to provide a high quality C
library for use with GCC on Atmel AVR microcontrollers.

AVR Libc is licensed under a single unified license. This so-called modified
Berkeley license is intented to be compatible with most Free Software licenses
like the GPL, yet impose as little restrictions for the use of the library in
closed-source commercial applications as possible.

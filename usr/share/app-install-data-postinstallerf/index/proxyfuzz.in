Comment3='
ProxyFuzz is a man-in-the-middle non-deterministic network fuzzier written in
Python. ProxyFuzz randomly changes (fuzzes) contents on the network traffic.
It supports TCP and UDP protocols and can also be configured to fuzz only one
side of the communication. ProxyFuzz is protocol agnostic so it can randomly
fuzz any network communication.

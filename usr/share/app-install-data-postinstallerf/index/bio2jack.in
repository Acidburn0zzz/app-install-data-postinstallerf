Bio (blocked i/o) 2 jack is a library for enabling easy porting of blocked
io(OSS/ALSA) applications to the jack sound server. This library allows the
person porting the code to simply replace the calls into OSS/ALSA with calls
into interface functions of this library. The library buffers a small amount of
audio data and takes care of the rest of the jack implementation including the
linked list of audio data buffers and the jack callback.

RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) is a protocol which allows
individual devices on an IP network to get their own IP addresses from the
RARP server.  Some machines (e.g. SPARC boxes) use this protocol instead
of e.g. DHCP to query their IP addresses during network bootup.
Linux kernels up to 2.2 used to provide a kernel daemon for this service,
but since 2.3 kernels it is served by this userland daemon.

You should install rarpd if you want to set up a RARP server on your
network.

Xvfb (X Virtual Frame Buffer) is an X server that is able to run on
machines with no display hardware and no physical input devices.
Xvfb simulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual memory.  Xvfb does
not open any devices, but behaves otherwise as an X display.  Xvfb
is normally used for testing servers.

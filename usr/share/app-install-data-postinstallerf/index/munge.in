Comment3='
MUNGE (MUNGE Uid N Gid Emporium) is an authentication service for creating
and validating credentials. It is designed to be highly scalable for use
in an HPC cluster environment.
It allows a process to authenticate the UID and GID of another local or
remote process within a group of hosts having common users and groups.
These hosts form a security realm that is defined by a shared cryptographic
key. Clients within this security realm can create and validate credentials
without the use of root privileges, reserved ports, or platform-specific
methods.

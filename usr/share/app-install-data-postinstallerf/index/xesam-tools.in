xesam-tools provides Python packages to interface with Xesam
compliant services as well as a command line tool to use directly.

It also features a framework for easily implementing xesam compliant
servers via the xesam.server package. There are two examples bundled
with this distribution. Namely demo/xesam-yahoo-service and
demo/xesam-dummy-service. Both include a small header describing
their usage.
The implementation uses gobject and the Python dbus bindings for the gobject

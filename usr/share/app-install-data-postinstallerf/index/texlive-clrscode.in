This package allows you to typeset pseudocode in the style of
Introduction to Algorithms, Second edition, by Cormen,
Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein. The package was written by the
authors. You use the commands the same way the packages author
did when writing the book, and your output will look just like
the pseudocode in the text.

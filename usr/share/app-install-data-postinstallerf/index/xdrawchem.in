XDrawChem is a two-dimensional molecule drawing program for Unix
operating systems.  It is similar in functionality to other molecule
drawing programs such as ChemDraw (TM, CambridgeSoft).  It can read
and write MDL Molfiles and CML files to allow sharing between
XDrawChem and other chemistry applications.

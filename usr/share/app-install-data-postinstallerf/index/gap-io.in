Comment3='
This GAP package provides a link to the standard UNIX I/O functionality
that is available through the C library.  This part basically consists
of functions on the GAP level that allow functions in the C library to
be called.

Built on top of this is a layer for buffered input/output which is
implemented completely in the GAP language.  It is intended to be used
by programs for which it is not necessary to have full direct access to
the operating system.

This package provides class, field, and method level annotations for
describing thread-safety policies.  These annotations are relatively
unintrusive and are beneficial to both users and maintainers.  Users can see
immediately whether a class is thread-safe, and maintainers can see
immediately whether thread-safety guarantees must be preserved.  Annotations
are also useful to a third constituency tools.  Static code-analysis tools
may be able to verify that the code complies with the contract indicated by
the annotation, such as verifying that a class annotated with @Immutable
actually is immutable.

QuaZIP is a simple C++ wrapper over Gilles Vollants ZIP/UNZIP package that
can be used to access ZIP archives. It uses Trolltechs Qt toolkit.

QuaZIP allows you to access files inside ZIP archives using QIODevice API,
and - yes! - that means that you can also use QTextStream, QDataStream or
whatever you would like to use on your zipped files.
QuaZIP provides complete abstraction of the ZIP/UNZIP API, for both reading
from and writing to ZIP archives.

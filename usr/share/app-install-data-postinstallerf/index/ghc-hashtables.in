Comment3='
This package provides a couple of different implementations of mutable
hash tables in the ST monad, as well as a typeclass abstracting their
common operations, and a set of wrappers to use the hash tables in the
IO monad.

This package currently contains three hash table implementations
1. Data.HashTable.ST.Basic contains a basic open-addressing hash table
using linear probing as the collision strategy.

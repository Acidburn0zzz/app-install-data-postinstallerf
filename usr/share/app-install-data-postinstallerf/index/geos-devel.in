GEOS (Geometry Engine - Open Source) is a C++ port of the Java Topology
Suite (JTS). As such, it aims to contain the complete functionality of
JTS in C++. This includes all the OpenGIS "Simple Features for SQL" spatial
predicate functions and spatial operators, as well as specific JTS topology
functions such as IsValid()

This package contains the development files to build applications that
use GEOS

Comment3='
mod_log_post can be used for logging all HTTP POST messages. The module
is based on mod_security but in difference it never returns any error
messages to the visitors of your websites. Logging of POST data can be
very useful for debugging purposes or analyses. As the module is loaded
and run after the SSL decryption, it even can log POST data transmitted
before via SSL to the Apache web server.

Haml (HTML Abstraction Markup Language) is a layer on top of XHTML or XML
thats designed to express the structure of XHTML or XML documents in a
non-repetitive, elegant, easy way, using indentation rather than closing
tags and allowing Ruby to be embedded with ease.
It was originally envisioned as a plugin for Ruby on Rails, but it can
function as a stand-alone templating engine.

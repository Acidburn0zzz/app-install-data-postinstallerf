originally written by the eminent author of Qmail, Dr D. J. Bernstein.
This *new* version of djbdns is a complete makeover to the original
source(djbdns-1.05) and is meant to make life a lot more pleasant. The
notable changes so far are in the set-up & configuration steps and
integration with the systemd(1) framework. This new release is free from
the clutches of `daemon-tools. The original source is in public-domain
since late Dec 2007(see http//cr.yp.to/distributors.html);

Laconic is a typeface font design meant to be dry without quite seeming
parched. Curves and diagonals are kept to a bare minimum without sacrificing
legibility. What it lacks in design features are more than made up for in
OpenType features. All the weights contain small caps, proportial figures,
old style figures, tabular figures, ligatures and stylistic alternates.

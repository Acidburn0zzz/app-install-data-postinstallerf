DeuTex is a wad composer for Doom, Heretic, Hexen and Strife. It can be
used to extract the lumps of a wad and save them as individual files.
Conversely, it can also build a wad from separate files. When extracting
a lump to a file, it does not just copy the raw data, it converts it to
an appropriate format (such as PPM for graphics, Sun audio for samples,
etc.). Conversely, when it reads files for inclusion in pwads, it does
the necessary conversions (for example, from PPM to Doom picture
format). In addition, DeuTex has functions such as merging wads, etc. If
youre doing any wad hacking beyond level editing, DeuTex is a must.

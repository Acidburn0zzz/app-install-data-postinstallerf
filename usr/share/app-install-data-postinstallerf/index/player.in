Player is a network server for robot control. Running on your robot, Player
provides a clean and simple interface to the robots sensors and actuators
over the IP network. Your client program talks to Player over a TCP socket,
reading data from sensors, writing commmands to actuators, and configuring
devices on the fly. Player supports a variety of robot hardware.

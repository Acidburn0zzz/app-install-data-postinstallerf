Comment3='
AllegroGL is an Allegro add-on that allows you to use OpenGL alongside Allegro.
You use OpenGL for your rendering to the screen, and Allegro for miscellaneous
tasks like gathering input, doing timers, getting cross-platform portability,
loading data, and drawing your textures. So this library fills the same hole
that things like glut do.

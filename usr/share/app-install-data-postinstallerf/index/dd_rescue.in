Comment3='
ddrescue is a utility similar to the system utility "dd" which copies
data from a file or block device to another. ddrescue does however
not abort on errors in the input file. This makes it suitable for
rescuing data from media with errors, e.g. a disk with bad sectors.

This package includes dd_rhelp, a wrapper script facilitating data
recovery.

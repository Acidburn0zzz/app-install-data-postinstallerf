Utilities for use with old-school dual head setups namely not
twinview / one big desktop, but rather two X screens.

mouse-switchscreen
  Change the mouse cursor from one screen to the other. Remembers the previous
  mouse position for each screen.
mouse-wrapscreen
  If you have an xorg.conf where both X screens are "separated" on the X
  coordinates, then the mouse cursor cannot cross. Which is sometimes desired,

Bacula is a set of programs that allow you to manage the backup, recovery, and
verification of computer data across a network of different computers. It is
based on a client/server architecture.

This package contains the storage daemon, the daemon responsible for writing
the data received from the clients onto tape drives or other mass storage
devices.

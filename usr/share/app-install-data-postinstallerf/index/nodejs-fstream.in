Comment3='
Provides advanced file system stream objects for Node.js.  These objects are
like FS streams, but with stat on them, and support directories and
symbolic links, as well as normal files.  Also, you can use them to set
the stats on a file, even if you dont change its contents, or to create
a symlink, etc.

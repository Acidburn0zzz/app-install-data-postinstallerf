A Scientific number is an arbitrary-precision floating-point number
represented using scientific notation.

A scientific number with coefficient c and base10Exponent e corresponds
to the Fractional number fromInteger c * 10 ^^ e
Its primary use-case is to serve as the target of parsing floating point
numbers. Since the textual representation of floating point numbers use
scientific notation they can be efficiently parsed to a Scientific number.

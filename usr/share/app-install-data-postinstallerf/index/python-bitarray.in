Bitarrays are sequence types and behave very much like usual lists.
Eight bits are represented by one byte in contiguous block of memory.
The user can select between two representations; little-endian and big-endian.
Most of the functionality is implemented in C.Methods for accessing the machine
representation are provided. This can be useful when bit level access to binary
files is required, such as portable bitmap image files (.pbm). Also, when
dealing with compressed data which uses variable bit length encoding
you may find this module useful.

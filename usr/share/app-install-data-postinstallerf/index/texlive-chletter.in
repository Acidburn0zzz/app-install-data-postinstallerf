Comment3='
The class enables composition of letters fitting into Swiss C5
& C6/5 windowed envelopes. No assumption is made about the
language used. The class is based on the standard LaTeX classes
and is compatible with the LaTeX letter class. It is not
limited to letters and may be used as a generic document class;
it is used with the chextras package.

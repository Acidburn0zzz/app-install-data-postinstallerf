The package creates slides for on-screen presentations based on
PDF features without manipulating TeXs typesetting process.
The presentation flow relies on PDFs abilities to display
content step by step. Features include - Free positioning of
anything anywhere in painted areas on the slide, as well as in
the main textblock; - Numerous attributes to control the layout
and the presentation flow, from TeXs primitive dimensions to
the visibility of steps; - Feature inheritance from global to
local settings, with intermediate types; - Basic drawing
facilities to produce symbols, e.g., for list items or buttons;

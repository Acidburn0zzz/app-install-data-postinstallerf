GasTeX is a set of LaTeX macros which enable the user to draw
graphs, automata, nets, diagrams, etc., very easily, in the
LaTeX picture environment. The package offers no documentation
(per se), but offers a couple of example files in the
distribution, and more on its home page. GasTeX generates its
own PostScript code, and therefore doesnt work directly under
PDFLaTeX.

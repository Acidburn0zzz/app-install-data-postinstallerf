IceS is a source client for a streaming server. The purpose of this client is
to provide an audio stream to a streaming server such that one or more
listeners can access the stream. With this layout, this source client can be
situated remotely from the icecast server.

The primary example of a streaming server used is Icecast 2, although others
could be used if certain conditions are met.

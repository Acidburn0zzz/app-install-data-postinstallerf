The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications
that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in. The Readline
library includes additional functions to maintain a list of previously-entered
command lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those lines, and perform csh-like
history expansion on previous commands.

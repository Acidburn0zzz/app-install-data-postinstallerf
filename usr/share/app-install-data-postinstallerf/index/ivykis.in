ivykis is a library for asynchronous I/O readiness notification.
It is a thin, portable wrapper around OS-provided mechanisms such
as epoll_create(2), kqueue(2), poll(2), poll(7d) (/dev/poll) and
port_create(3C).

ivykis was mainly designed for building high-performance network
applications, but can be used in any event-driven application that
uses poll(2)able file descriptors as its event sources.

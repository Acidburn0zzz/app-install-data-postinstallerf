NorduGrid is a collaboration aiming at development, maintenance and
support of the free Grid middleware, known as the Advanced Resource
Connector (ARC).

For the regular user of any ARC-based computational grid,
this client package contains (or depends on) all packages
that are needed to submit jobs, query their status and
retrieve results.

IFStatus was developed for Linux users that are usually in console mode.
It is a simple, easy to use program for displaying commonly needed / wanted
statistics in real time about ingoing and outgoing traffic of multiple
network interfaces that is usually hard to find, with a simple and
effecient view. It is the substitute for PPPStatus and EthStatus projects.

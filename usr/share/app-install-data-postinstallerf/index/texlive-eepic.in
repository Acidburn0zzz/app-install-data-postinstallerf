Extensions to epic and the LaTeX picture drawing environment,
include the drawing of lines at any slope, the drawing of
circles in any radii, and the drawing of dotted and dashed
lines much faster with much less TeX memory, and providing
several new commands for drawing ellipses, arcs, splines, and
filled circles and ellipses. The package uses tpic \special
commands.

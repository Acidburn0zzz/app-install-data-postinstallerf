Akismet is a web service for recognizing spam comments. It promises to be
almost 100% effective at catching comment spam. They say that currently 81%
of all comments submitted to them are spam.Its designed to work with the
Wordpress Blog Tool, but its not restricted to that so this is a Python
interface to the Akismet API.

HSQLdb is a relational database engine written in JavaTM , with a JDBC
driver, supporting a subset of ANSI-92 SQL. It offers a small (about
100k), fast database engine which offers both in memory and disk based
tables. Embedded and server modes are available. Additionally, it
includes tools such as a minimal web server, in-memory query and
management tools (can be run as applets or servlets, too) and a number
of demonstration examples.
Downloaded code should be regarded as being of production quality. The
product is currently being used as a database and persistence engine in
many Open Source Software projects and even in commercial projects and

John Baskerville (1706-1775) got involed in typography late in his career but
his contribution was significant. He was a successful entrepreneur and
possesed an inquiring mind which he applied to produce many aesthetic and
technical innovations in printing. He invented a new ink formula, a new type
of smooth paper and made various improvements in the printing press. He was
also involved in type design which resulted in a latin typeface which was used
for the edition of Virgil, in 1757. The quality of the type was admired
throughout of Europe and America and was revived with great success in the
early 20th century.

HttpUnit emulates the relevant portions of browser behavior, including form
submission, JavaScript, basic http authentication, cookies and automatic page
redirection, and allows Java test code to examine returned pages either as
text, an XML DOM, or containers of forms, tables, and links.
A companion framework, ServletUnit is included in the package.

US English female speaker ("SLT") voice for Festival.

This is a HMM-based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) voice from the Nagoya
Institute of Technology, trained using the CMU ARCTIC database. This voice
is based on 1132 utterances spoken by a US English female speaker. The
speaker is experienced in building synthetic voices. This was recorded at
16bit 32KHz, in a sound proof room, in stereo, one channel was the waveform,
the other EGG. The database was automatically labelled using CMU Sphinx
using the FestVox labelling scripts. No hand correction has been made.

This is libkate, the reference implementation of a codec for the Kate bitstream
format.
Kate is a karaoke and text codec meant for encapsulation in an Ogg container.
It can carry text, images, and animate them.

Kate is meant to be used for karaoke alongside audio/video streams (typically
Vorbis and Theora), movie subtitles, song lyrics, and anything that needs text
data at arbitrary time intervals.

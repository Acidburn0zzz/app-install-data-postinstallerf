Comment3='
Muffin is a window and compositing manager that displays and manages
your desktop via OpenGL. Muffin combines a sophisticated display engine
using the Clutter toolkit with solid window-management logic inherited
from the Metacity window manager.

While Muffin can be used stand-alone, it is primarily intended to be
used as the display core of a larger system such as Cinnamon.
For this reason, Muffin is very extensible via plugins, which
are used both to add fancy visual effects and to rework the window
management behaviors to meet the needs of the environment.

PerlCritic is an extensible framework for creating and applying coding
standards to Perl source code. Essentially, it is a static source code
analysis engine. PerlCritic is distributed with a number of
PerlCriticPolicy modules that attempt to enforce various coding
guidelines. Most Policy modules are based on Damian Conways book Perl
Best Practices. However, PerlCritic is not limited to PBP and will
even support Policies that contradict Conway. You can enable, disable,
and customize those Polices through the PerlCritic interface. You can
also create new Policy modules that suit your own tastes.

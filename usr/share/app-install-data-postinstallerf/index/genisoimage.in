The genisoimage program is used as a pre-mastering program; i.e., it
generates the ISO9660 file-system. Genisoimage takes a snapshot of
a given directory tree and generates a binary image of the tree
which will correspond to an ISO9660 file-system when written to
a block device. Genisoimage is used for writing CD-ROMs, and includes
support for creating boot-able El Torito CD-ROMs.

Install the genisoimage package if you need a program for writing
CD-ROMs.

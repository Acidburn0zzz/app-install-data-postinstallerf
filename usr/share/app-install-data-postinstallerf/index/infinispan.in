Comment3='
Infinispan is an extremely scalable, highly available data grid
platform - 100% open source, and written in Java. The purpose of
Infinispan is to expose a data structure that is highly concurrent,
designed ground-up to make the most of modern multi-processor/multi-core
architectures while at the same time providing distributed cache
capabilities.  At its core Infinispan exposes a Cache interface which
extends java.util.Map. It is also optionally is backed by a peer-to-peer
network architecture to distribute state efficiently around a data grid.

Synergy lets you easily share your mouse and keyboard between multiple
computers, where each computer has its own display. No special hardware is
required, all you need is a local area network. Synergy is supported on
Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Redirecting the mouse and keyboard is as simple
as moving the mouse off the edge of your screen.

JaxoDraw is a Java program for drawing Feynman diagrams. It has a complete
graphical user interface that allows to carry out all actions in a mouse
click-and-drag fashion. Fine-tuning of the diagrams is also possible through
keyboard entries. Graphs may be exported to (encapsulated) postscript and can
be saved in XML files to be used in later sessions.

phpass (pronounced "pH pass") is a portable public domain password hashing
framework for use in PHP applications. It is meant to work with PHP 3 and
above.

The preferred (most secure) hashing method supported by phpass is the
OpenBSD-style Blowfish-based bcrypt and known in PHP as CRYPT_BLOWFISH, with
a fallback to BSDI-style extended DES-based hashes, known in PHP as
CRYPT_EXT_DES, and a last resort fallback to MD5-based salted and variable
iteration count password hashes implemented in phpass
itself (also referred to as portable hashes).

The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW) is a cross-platform C/C++
extension loading library. GLEW provides efficient run-time mechanisms for
determining which OpenGL extensions are supported on the target platform.
OpenGL core and extension functionality is exposed in a single header file.
GLEW is available for a variety of operating systems, including Windows, Linux,
Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Irix, and Solaris.

This package contains the demo GLEW utilities.  The libraries themselves
are in libGLEW and libGLEWmx.

The Network Information Service (NIS) is a system that provides
network information (login names, passwords, home directories, group
information) to all of the machines on a network. NIS can allow users
to log in on any machine on the network, as long as the machine has
the NIS client programs running and the users password is recorded in
the NIS passwd database. NIS was formerly known as Sun Yellow Pages
(YP).

This package provides the ypbind daemon. The ypbind daemon binds NIS
clients to an NIS domain. Ypbind must be running on any machines

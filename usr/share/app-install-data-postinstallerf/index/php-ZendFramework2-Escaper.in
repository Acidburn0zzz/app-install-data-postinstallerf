Comment3='
The OWASP Top 10 web security risks study lists Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
in second place. PHP?s sole functionality against XSS is limited to two
functions of which one is commonly misapplied. Thus, the Zend\Escaper component
was written. It offers developers a way to escape output and defend from XSS
and related vulnerabilities by introducing contextual escaping based on
peer-reviewed rules.

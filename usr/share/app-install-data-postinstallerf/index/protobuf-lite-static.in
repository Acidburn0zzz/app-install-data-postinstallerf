Comment3='
This package contains static development libraries built with
optimize_for = LITE_RUNTIME.

The "optimize_for = LITE_RUNTIME" option causes the compiler to generate code
which only depends libprotobuf-lite, which is much smaller than libprotobuf but
lacks descriptors, reflection, and some other features.

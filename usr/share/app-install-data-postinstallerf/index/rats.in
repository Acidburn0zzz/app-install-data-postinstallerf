Comment3='
RATS scans through code, finding potentially dangerous function calls.
The goal of this tool is not to definitively find bugs (yet). The
current goal is to provide a reasonable starting point for performing
manual security audits.

The initial vulnerability database is taken directly from things that
could be easily found when starting with the forthcoming book,
"Building Secure Software" by Viega and McGraw.

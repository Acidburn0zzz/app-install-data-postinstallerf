If you have \cite commands in \section-like commands, or in
\caption, the citation will also appear in the table of
contents, or list of whatever. If you are also using an unsrt-
like bibliography style, these citations will come at the very
start of the bibliography, which is confusing. This package
suppresses the effect.

Comment3='
The forks.pm module is a drop-in replacement for threads.pm.  It has the
same syntax as the threads.pm module (it even takes over its namespace) but
has some significant differences

- you do _not_ need a special (threaded) version of Perl
- it is _much_ more economic with memory usage on OSs that support COW
- it is more efficient in the startup of threads
- it is slightly less efficient in the stopping of threads
- it is less efficient in inter-thread communication

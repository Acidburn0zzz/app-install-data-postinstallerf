Dockapp which displays acpi/apm information.
his is a typical laptop ACPI dockapp. One interesting feature is the "timer"
mode, where you can keep track of how long the laptop has been "on battery".
This is opposite of the information usually provided by the BIOS, which is
"time remaining", and in many cases wrong. This option can be toggled at
run-time. System messages scroll on the bottom of the window, AC plug flashes
when battery is charging, and green LED inside the big button flashes red if
battery level is critical low.

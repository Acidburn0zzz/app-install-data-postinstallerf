CP2K is a freely available (GPL) program, written in Fortran 95, to
perform atomistic and molecular simulations of solid state, liquid,
molecular and biological systems. It provides a general framework for
different methods such as e.g. density functional theory (DFT) using a
mixed Gaussian and plane waves approach (GPW), and classical pair and
many-body potentials.
CP2K does not implement Car-Parinello Molecular Dynamics (CPMD).

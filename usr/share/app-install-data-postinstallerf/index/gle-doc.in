GLE (Graphics Layout Engine) is a high-quality graphics package for
scientists, combining a user-friendly scripting language with a full
range of facilities for producing publication-quality graphs, diagrams,
posters and slides. GLE provides LaTeX quality fonts together with a
flexible graphics module which allows the user to specify any feature of
a graph. Complex pictures can be drawn with user-defined subroutines and
simple looping structures. Current output formats include EPS, PS, PDF,
JPEG, and PNG.

This package contains the user documentation.

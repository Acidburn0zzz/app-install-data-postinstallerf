Chipmunk is a 2D rigid body physics library distributed under the MIT license.
Though not yet complete, it is intended to be fast, numerically stable, and
easy to use.

This package contains the header files and  static libraries to develop
programs that will use the chipmunk library.  You should
install this package if you need to develop programs which will use the
chipmunk library functions.  Youll also need to install the chipmunk package.

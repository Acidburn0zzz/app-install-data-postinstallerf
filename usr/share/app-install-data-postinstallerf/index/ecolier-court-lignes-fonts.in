?colier court fonts were created by Jean-Marie Douteau to mimic the
traditional cursive writing French children are taught in school.
He kindly released two of them under the OFL, which are redistributed in
this package.
The ? lignes ? (lines) ?colier court font variant includes the Seyes lining
commonly used by schoolchildren notepads.

Provides support for parsing and emitting Yaml documents.

The package is broken down into two modules. "Data.Yaml" provides a high-level
interface based around the JSON datatypes provided by the aeson package.
"Text.Libyaml" provides a lower-level, streaming interface. For most users,
"Data.Yaml" is recommended.

FakeNES is an Open Source NES emulator.  It uses the excellent Allegro
multimedia library for input, graphics, and sound effects/music across
various platforms.  It is written in 100% C, and was originally designed to
run on DOS and Microsoft Windows, but now features a POSIX build system as
well.  There are also official builds available for Mac OS X.

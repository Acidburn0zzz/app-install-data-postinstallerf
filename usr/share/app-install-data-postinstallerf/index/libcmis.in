LibCMIS is a C++ client library for working with CM (content management)
interfaces. The primary supported interface (which gave the library its
name) is CMIS, which allows applications to connect to any ECM behaving
as a CMIS server (Alfresco or Nuxeo are examples of open source ones).
Another supported interface is Google Drive.

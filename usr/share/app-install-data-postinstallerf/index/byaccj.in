Comment3='
BYACC/J is an extension of the Berkeley v 1.8 YACC-compatible
parser generator. Standard YACC takes a YACC source file, and
generates one or more C files from it, which if compiled properly,
will produce a LALR-grammar parser. This is useful for expression
parsing, interactive command parsing, and file reading. Many
megabytes of YACC code have been written over the years.
This is the standard YACC tool that is in use every day to produce
C/C++ parsers. I have added a "-J" flag which will cause BYACC to
generate Java source code, instead. So there finally is a YACC for
Java now!

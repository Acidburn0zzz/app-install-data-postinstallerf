Comment3='
Gocl is a GLib/GObject based library that aims at simplifying the
use of OpenCL in GNOME software. It is intended to be a lightweight
wrapper that adapts OpenCL programming patterns and boilerplate, and
expose a simpler API that is known and comfortable to GNOME
developers. Examples of such adaptations are the integration with
GLib?s main loop, exposing non-blocking APIs, GError based error
reporting and full gobject-introspection support. It will also be
including convenient API to simplify code for the most common use
patterns.

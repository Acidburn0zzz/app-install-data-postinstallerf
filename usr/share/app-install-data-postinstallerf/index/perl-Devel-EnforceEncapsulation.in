Encapsulation is the practice of creating subroutines to access the properties
of a class instead of accessing those properties directly. The advantage of
good encapsulation is that the author is permitted to change the internal
implementation of a class without breaking its usage.

Object-oriented programming in Perl is most commonly implemented via blessed
hashes. This practice makes it easy for users of a class to violate
encapsulation by simply accessing the hash values directly. Although less
common, the same applies to classes implemented via blessed arrays, scalars,
filehandles, etc.

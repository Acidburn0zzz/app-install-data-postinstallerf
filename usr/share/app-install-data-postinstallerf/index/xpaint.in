XPaint is an X Window System color image bitmap editing program.
It also supports advanced features, such as image processing
algorithms, scripting and batch jobs. XPaint allows the edition
of multiple images simultaneously and supports a wide variety of
image formats, including GIF, JPG, PNG, PPM, TIFF, XBM, XPM, etc.

xpaint is now fully UTF8 compliant, and is capable of using anti-aliased
truetype fonts in its operations and in the menus (in particular,
translating to oriental languages should now be quite easy - also
the X core font protocol is no longer used anywhere.)

The Inspector is an UPnP Device and Service analyzer, and a debugging tool,
based on the Coherence DLNA/UPnP framework.

It is a GUI to discover and explore UPnP devices on your network. Detected
devices are displayed in a tree-view, where - amongst other things - actions
can be called and state-variables be queried.

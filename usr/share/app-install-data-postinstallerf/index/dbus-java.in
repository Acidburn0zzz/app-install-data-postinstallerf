D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to
talk to one another. In addition to interprocess communication,
D-Bus helps coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and
reliable to code a "single instance" application or daemon, and to
launch applications and daemons on demand when their services are
needed.

This is a complete independent implementation of the D-Bus protocol
in Java. It comprises a library to write programs in Java which
access D-Bus, a tool for generating stubs from D-Bus introspection

rasdaemon is a RAS (Reliability, Availability and Serviceability) logging tool.
It currently records memory errors, using the EDAC tracing events.
EDAC is drivers in the Linux kernel that handle detection of ECC errors
from memory controllers for most chipsets on i386 and x86_64 architectures.
EDAC drivers for other architectures like arm also exists.
This userspace component consists of an init script which makes sure
EDAC drivers and DIMM labels are loaded at system startup, as well as
an utility for reporting current error counts from the EDAC sysfs files.

The goals of ShellCheck are

  - To point out and clarify typical beginners syntax issues,
    that causes a shell to give cryptic error messages.
  - To point out and clarify typical intermediate level semantic problems,
    that causes a shell to behave strangely and counter-intuitively.
  - To point out subtle caveats, corner cases and pitfalls, that may cause an
    advanced users otherwise working script to fail under future circumstances.

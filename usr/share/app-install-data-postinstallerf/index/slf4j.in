Comment3='
The Simple Logging Facade for Java or (SLF4J) is intended to serve
as a simple facade for various logging APIs allowing to the end-user
to plug in the desired implementation at deployment time. SLF4J also
allows for a gradual migration path away from
Jakarta Commons Logging (JCL).

Logging API implementations can either choose to implement the
SLF4J interfaces directly, e.g. NLOG4J or SimpleLogger. Alternatively,
it is possible (and rather easy) to write SLF4J adapters for the given
API implementation, e.g. Log4jLoggerAdapter or JDK14LoggerAdapter..

Comment3='
nose-progressive is a nose plugin which displays progress in a stationary
progress bar, freeing the rest of the screen (as well as the scrollback buffer)
for the compact display of test failures, which it formats beautifully and
usefully. It displays failures and errors as soon as they occur and avoids
scrolling them off the screen in favor of less useful output. It also offers
a number of other human-centric features to speed the debugging process.

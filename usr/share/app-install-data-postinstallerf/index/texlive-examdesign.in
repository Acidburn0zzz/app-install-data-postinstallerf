This bundle provides a class examdesign. The class provides
several features useful for designing tests or question sets -
it allows for explicit markup of questions and answers; - the
class will, at the users request, automatically generate
answer keys; - multiple versions of the same test can be
generated automatically, with the ordering of questions within
each section randomly permuted so as to minimize cheating; -
the generated answer keys can be constructed either with or
without the questions included; - environments are provided to
assist in constructing the most common types of test question

Doctrine is an object relational mapper (ORM) for PHP 5.2.3+ that sits on top
of a powerful database abstraction layer (DBAL). One of its key features is the
option to write database queries in a proprietary object oriented SQL dialect
called Doctrine Query Language (DQL), inspired by Hibernates HQL. This provides
developers with a powerful alternative to SQL that maintains flexibility
without requiring unnecessary code duplication.

Comment3='SportsTracker is an application for recording sporting activities. It is not bound to a specific kind of sport, as categories can be created for all sport types, such as cycling, running or tennis. The main advantages are the good overview of your exercises and the easy creation of exercise statistics for specific time ranges and sport types.
Users of heartrate monitors (Polar and CicloSport) can import, display (including diagrams) and organize the recorded exercise data with the integrated PolarViewer component.'

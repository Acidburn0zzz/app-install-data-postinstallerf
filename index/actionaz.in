Comment3='Actionaz is a task automation tool. It allows you to create and execute action lists.

You do not need to know any programming language to use it: its intuitive interface allows you to create action lists (scripts) using drag &amp; drop.

Advanced users can use JavaScript (EcmaScript) to extend its functionality.'
